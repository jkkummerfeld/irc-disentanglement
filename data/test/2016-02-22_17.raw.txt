[07:37] <zamba> i believe i'm running gnome classic
[07:39] <PestBuda> zamba: why change ctrl alt right arrow?
[07:39] <opeik> Hello
[07:39] <zamba> PestBuda: because i want to? :)
[07:40] <opeik> My USB keyboard doesn't work on login, I have to unplug and replug for it to work
[07:40] <opeik> It's getting power because the LEDs are on, so I'm really puzzled
[07:40] <PestBuda> opeik: what are you running?
[07:40] <opeik> Ubuntu 15.10
[07:41] <Woovie> Getting some insane errors beyond my comprehension after my fellow admin tried installation of VirtualBox. https://ybin.me/p/4034d5ab96cc5f22#aC9mhRecl0AdsqahWwFFXJVYOg9GdrZTPJqDzq3ouQI=
[07:41] <PestBuda> have you tried a different USB keyboard?
[07:41] <opeik> Yes, it works fine
[07:41] <opeik> I bought a new one somewhat recently and this one has issues
[07:41] <PestBuda> opeik: the New one has issues?
[07:41] <opeik> Yes
[07:42] <PestBuda> try disable/enable "usb legacy support" in bios
[07:42] <opeik> Oh if it makes any difference
[07:42] <opeik> The keyboard works fine in the BIOS and for GRUB
[07:43] <opeik> It's only when it gets to the Ubuntu login screen where nothing happens
[07:43] <PestBuda> try it

[07:45] <Razva> I have two nics, both with static IPs. if I set an IP to the first nic, the settings get auto-applied on the second one. why?! using GNOME.
[07:46] <PestBuda> paranoid admin Razva?
[07:46] <Razva> PestBuda sorry?
[07:47] <PestBuda> Razva: are you talking about irc nicks?
[07:47] <opeik> Hello again
[07:47] <PestBuda> opeik: did it work?
[07:47] <opeik> There was no such option, but just for the hell of it I reset the BIOS to the factory default
[07:47] <opeik> It's working now?
[07:47] <Razva> PestBuda no, about NICs, network interfaces :)
[07:47] <opeik> I'm more confused than I was a minute ago
[07:47] <PestBuda> opeik: lol
[07:48] <PestBuda> ohh NIC... ok
[07:48] <PestBuda> opeik: its not yours to question why, your's is just to do and die... LMAO
[07:48] <Razva> PestBuda I suppose there's a difference between a nick and a nic :D
[07:49] <opeik> Welp
[07:49] <PestBuda> ok Razva, tell me again...
[07:50] <Drac0666>  I have problem with my Ubuntu mate 15, after reboot i often have no sounds, sometimes i have to run app (spotify) twice or more to hear something from spearking. Profile and Device in settings is correct (Maya u5 usb card) when i type pactl list sinks short i recive RUNNING on maya and still i hear nothing on speakrs
[07:50] <Razva> PestBuda I have two NICs, both with static IPs. When I set the IP for the first one, the same IP is auto-applied to the second one, no idea why! I'm using GNOME Ubuntu because I need a browser on this specific server
[07:50] <PestBuda> opeik: if you really want to get Dangerous.... flash a new/updated Bios...
[07:50] <opeik> I'd rather not hey
[07:50] <opeik> But one thing that was interesting
[07:51] <opeik> Usually before the NVIDEA X server starts, you can see "USB debouce failed" or something like that
[07:51] <opeik> It wasn't there this time
[07:52] <PestBuda> its likely CF with your keyboard manufacturer , and outdated bios, or a kernel fubar
[07:52] <opeik> Imma restart just to be certain
[07:53] <PestBuda> Razva: its realy strange... why would ip settings be auto applied to a second nic
[07:53] <PestBuda> what are you using for ip config ?
[07:54] <PestBuda> I think its the package you're using that might be unused to dealing with two nics on the system

[07:55] <PestBuda> perdana: hey
[07:56] <jushur> Drac0666: do you use the built in audio card at all? if not disable the module. and i bet your problem will go away.
[07:59] <PestBuda> Drac0666: I would also suggest disable/enable "usb legacy support" in bios... or reset the bios to factory specs... I've seen similar "issues" with Detection of USB devices,
[07:59] <Drac0666> jushur here are some commands http://pastebin.com/YeaeT26f
[07:59] <Drac0666> jushur: only other card is detected is ATI HDMI...
[07:59] <Drac0666> PestBuda, onboard MSI card is disabled (realtek)

[08:00] <Drac0666> PestBuda, http://pastebin.com/nTaFAik1
[08:00] <PestBuda> Drac0666: just out of curiosity why arent you using the onboard?
[08:01] <Drac0666> PestBuda, audiophile stupidty ;p i have maya u5 wich plays better than this onboard
[08:01] <Drac0666> more configuration etc
[08:01] <Drac0666> and headphones amplifier
[08:02] <Drac0666> card is for 100% fine cuz on windows i have 0 problems
[08:02] <PestBuda> Drac0666: I dont see anything in that pastebin that even resembles an audio card...
[08:02] <Drac0666> as i mentioned before sometimes i have to type: spotify-> killall spotify few times before i hear something

[08:03] <Drac0666> its VIA audiotrak maya u5
[08:04] <PestBuda> Drac0666: so its showing, in lsusb, but its not playing in SPOTIFY?
[08:04] <Drac0666> PestBuda, its not like that - its sometimes not playing
[08:04] <Drac0666> 50% chances lets say
[08:05] <Drac0666> if i dont hear sound i kill spotify and start it again
[08:05] <Drac0666> i might get sound
[08:05] <Drac0666> if i dont i kill again
[08:05] <PestBuda> Drac0666: my question is ... when its not working- is it still showing in lsusb?
[08:05] <Drac0666> yes
[08:05] <lostmyshortcutpo> hey does anyone knowhow to restore the order of the bookmarks in nautilus?
[08:05] <Drac0666> PestBuda, its even shown in pactl list sinks short
[08:06] <Drac0666> but i hear nothing
[08:06] <PestBuda> Drac0666: well I hate to tell you but I would accuse the manufacturer of that card.... your best hope is to see if they have a new linux driver release... for that device
[08:07] <Drac0666> PestBuda, well they dont ;/
[08:08] <Drac0666> PestBuda, maybe You know where i can turn off usb suspend on idle?
[08:09] <Drac0666> PestBuda, http://pastebin.com/cX3dMXY4
[08:10] <PestBuda> Drac0666: I would try "xset -dpms
[08:11] <Drac0666> PestBuda, should it return something?
[08:11] <PestBuda> no
[08:12] <jushur> Drac0666: if you do aplay -l , shows your usb card as card 0?
[08:12] <PestBuda> Drac0666: it will just disable power managerment
[08:12] <Drac0666> jushur, no
[08:12] <Drac0666> jushur, its 1
[08:12] <jushur> Drac0666: any card listed before it?

[08:13] <Drac0666> jushur, http://pastebin.com/YeaeT26f
[08:15] <jushur> Drac0666: learn what modules they use and then blacklist them in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-soundmodules.conf (you caa name it whatever you want. all files with .conf in there gets parsed at boot)
[08:16] <Drac0666> jushur how i can get info about what modules are used by hdi ati?
[08:16] <jushur> Drac0666: make sure you dont blacklist the usb soundcard modules just =)
[08:18] <jushur> Drac0666: open a terminal do lspci -vnn
[08:18] <Drac0666> jushur, it will be kernel driver in use, correct?
[08:19] <jushur> Drac0666: yes
[08:20] <jushur> Drac0666: driver/module should be the same as far i know so.
[08:20] <Drac0666> jushur, i think so too, done it gonna reboot brb
[08:21] <PestBuda> Drac0666: pastebin === "locate via"     i'm specifically interested in via or Via... located in /sys/bus/usb/devices/
[08:23] <Drac0666> jushur, now i have no hdi ati audio
[08:23] <Drac0666> jushur, but atm i have no sound from speakers either
[08:23] <Drac0666> jushur, my usb card is still listed as 1 there is nothing with 0
[08:24] <jushur> Drac0666: you created any /etc/asound.conf file or so?
[08:26] <Drac0666> jushur, i dont
[08:26] <Drac0666> jushur, http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Asoundrc this guide would be correct to do it?
[08:28] <jushur> Drac0666: y
[08:28] <jushur> but i find it odd that your card is not listed as card 0 now
[08:29] <Drac0666> jushur, yup.. maybe it is binded somewhere else?
[08:35] <Drac0666> jushur, going to rebot i have done my config

[08:42] <jushur> Drac0666: crap behind the keyboard xD
[08:43] <Drac0666> :D
[08:43] <jushur> Drac0666: it tends to be like that after a while. if you have troubles you edit settings all over the place and some you forget to return.
[08:43] <Drac0666> ok im gonna make few reboots to see its permanent
[08:43] <Drac0666> jushur, well its like my third distro wich im trying
[08:44] <Drac0666> jushur, cuz on previous i have made so many changes that i had no sound at all
[08:45] <Drac0666> jushur, except making that config file i have turned off suspend-on-idle in pulseaudio and i dont know wich one helped me now ;p

[08:54] <shoerain> any ideas on tuning, or at least identifying problems with SSDs? my samsung 840 pro gets much slower speeds than my crucial m4, at least according to hdparm -Tt, 220MB/s buffered read speeds on the crucial m4, 80MB/s buffered read speeds on the 840 pro. any ideas to figure out the discrepancy?
[08:55] <jushur> shoerain: look at its firmware version

[09:26] <somsip> jonsaint: you are in it
[09:28] <jonsaint> ah ok. im new to this after coming off win 10. had enough of it so thought i would try something fresh and new for a change
[09:30] <shoerain> jushur: well, i know it's not running the latest firmware, so i guess i can update it. but the ssd runs faster on another laptop, and my crucial m4 runs fine on this as well (exact same model, i have 2 thinkpad x200 models)
[09:31] <shoerain> Drac0666: damn, any other suggestions for benchmarking? i've been using bonnie++, but that might skew results since i'm not using luks over lvm on both drives.
[09:33] <jushur> shoerain: bad sata connector maybe?
[09:34] <jushur> shoerain: laptop bios?

[10:13] <purity^> jonsaint, hmm, how did you install skype? If you start skype from the terminal and then close the terminal, it will also close skype
[10:14] <purity^> if you installed it by the package manager you should have an icon tough
[10:14] <jonsaint> i went on to skype, downloaded it and it was in my download folder, i clicked on it and it took me to the software centre and i installed from there.
[10:15] <EriC^^> jonsaint: type skype in the dash
[10:15] <PowerKiller> jonsaint: well
[10:15] <jonsaint> i originally went to software centre but couldnt find skype when i typed it in
[10:15] <purity^> weird, do you run the DE that comes with ubuntu?
[10:15] <PowerKiller> well this is a known fact of Skype
[10:15] <PowerKiller> and don't use Skype in the first place
[10:15] <PowerKiller> it's infected by NSA

[10:17] <PowerKiller> I'm not either :P

[10:17] <purity^> start skype with skype & should do the trick from the terminal?
[10:18] <jonsaint> il try it
[10:18] <purity^> jonsaint, anyway, the link I gave you explains how you create an icon shourtcut
[10:18] <EriC^^> no, it would still let it close if he presses the terminal "x"
[10:18] <PowerKiller> well it will make all stdout work tho

[11:51] <eltigre> any idea?
[11:51] <bekks> Sparese file contained in the archive, or not enough free inodes on the disk.
[11:52] <bekks> *Sparse
[11:52] <eltigre> what does "sparse" mean in this context?
[11:52] <eltigre> and what to do about not enough inodes?
[11:53] <bekks> Sparse means that it needs much more free space on your disk, and "not enough inodes" can be solved by freeing up inodes.
[11:53] <eltigre> bekks ok, so how to I free up inodes without deleting files?
[11:54] <bekks> eltigre: No way.
[11:54] <eltigre> hmpf :-(
[11:54] <eltigre> I guess I need to buy a new drive to swap the data...
[11:54] <bekks> eltigre: Just check wether you are out of inodes.
[11:54] <EriC^^> eltigre: try df -i
[11:55] <eltigre> yes it's out of inodes

[11:56] <EriC^^> eltigre: try sudo apt-get autoclean
[11:57] <bekks> peyron: as long as your script does not contain sensitive data, there is nothing to worry about.
[11:57] <eltigre> the drive is a vfat drive... that's why I am thinking I have to buy another, and move the data over
[11:57] <eltigre> EriC^^,  would that help on an external vfat drive?
[11:57] <EriC^^> eltigre: oh, no
[11:59] <peyron> bekks: I mean it has the absolute paths to the password database files and my hostname, would that be considered sensitive with password authentication off?
[11:59] <EriC^^> eltigre: is it fat32?
[11:59] <bekks> peyron: Without you having access to my system, I can safely tell you that I'm storing a lot of sensitive data under /data/private/
[11:59] <eltigre> EriC^^, it says vfat

[13:16] <silv3r_m00n> k1l_: Ubuntu
[13:17] <k1l_> silv3r_m00n: then just use "dd"
[13:18] <WereCatf> k1l_: The metapackage is already installed automatically when installing cinnamon-desktop-environment.

[13:18] <CountryfiedLinux> Is it possible to make my own repository with multiple PPAs?
[13:19] <sparks_> can someone tell me how to fix this... resize2fs: Can't read a block bitmap while trying to resize
[13:19] <lotuspsychje> !repo | CountryfiedLinux
[13:19] <ubottu> CountryfiedLinux: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecommendedSources for the recommended way to set up your repositories.
[13:19] <l00p> hi I'm planing to attach two different SATA hard disk to my computer what commands should I learn for i? Are fdisk and mount enough?
[13:19] <k1l_> WereCatf: dont know then about cinnamon.
[13:20] <lotuspsychje> l00p: commands for learn what?
[13:20] <WereCatf> I just don't see the point in keeping obviously-broken packages in Ubuntu's repos.
[13:20] <l00p> lotuspsychje: I need to format the hardrive?
[13:20] <lotuspsychje> l00p: you can format a hd from within ubuntu
[13:20] <bekks> l00p: You dont format a harddrive, but a filesystem only.
[13:22] <l00p> lotuspsychje: bekks : it's from old laptop and it contains windows operating system so thats why I'm going to format it
[13:22] <bekks> l00p: you dont need to format it at all. you need to create a new filesystem instead.
[13:23] <l00p> bekks: ok so fdisk is enough for it?
[13:24] <bekks> l00p: fdisk creates/deletes partitions, it doesnt format/create filesystems.
[13:24] <bekks> l00p: I guess you are better off using gparted instead.
[13:24] <lotuspsychje> l00p: how about you tell us to full story? wich drive with windows? singleboot/dualboot?
[13:24] <l00p> bekks: thanks :) I begin to read gparted manual
[13:25] <bekks> l00p: Better tel us the whole story before :)
[13:25] <bekks> *tell
[13:25] <sudosuminus> l00p: I can help too with partitions and gparted
[13:26] <sparks_> can someone help me? i've been asking the same question now for 3 days lol :D
[13:27] <lotuspsychje> sparks_: tell us again
[13:27] <sudosuminus> sparks_: let us know today
[13:27] <lotuspsychje> lol
[13:27] <l00p> lotuspsychje: Our old vista laptop broke and I'm planning to buy SATA cable and attach to it to my linux desktop computer. I'm not going to use windows vista so I just want the extra harddisk space from it. I haven't bought the cabble yet. But I came to here to seek information in advance. So I can read manuals and prepare myself
[13:28] <lotuspsychje> l00p: your gonna install ubuntu on the second sata with external cable?
[13:28] <cfhowlett> sparks_, https://inkscape.org/media/cms_page_media/56/ask-smart-questions.pdf
[13:28] <sparks_> I went to shrink my raid array, which I did successfully however, I forgot to shrink the file system first.. my big mistake of course :/. Now, when I issue an resize2fs I get the following: resize2fs: Can't read a block bitmap while trying to resize
[13:29] <sudosuminus> cfhowlett: that was mean, let he/her ask
[13:29] <lotuspsychje> !raid | sparks_
[13:29] <ubottu> sparks_: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO - For software RAID, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto
[13:29] <sparks_> i've read all of that
[13:30] <l00p> lotuspsychje: no. I have already have ubuntu installed. I'm going to attach/mount the extra harddrive to my ubuntu os. Sry if my english isn't understandable :D
[13:30] <bekks> sparks_: your filesystem is entirely broken. Recreate your fs, and restore your files from your backup.
[13:31] <sparks_> well, I thought of that option bekks, but I also figured there must be a way to fix the block size on the file system.. which is the main issue that fsck complains about when attempting to run
[13:31] <l00p> lotuspsychje: like u know. Extra harddrive space for pics and .odt documents :)
[13:32] <bekks> sparks_: the main issue is a broken filesystem, with a broken bitmap as one particular issue of it.
[13:32] <sudosuminus1> cfhowlett: really? how mature!
[13:32] <lotuspsychje> sudosuminus: move on please
[13:32] <bekks> sparks_: It's like having a cake, cut it in half, and try to restore the second half from looking at the first half.
[13:33] <CountryfiedLinux> I'll look at that thanks lotuspsychje
[13:33] <sparks_> ahhh... hmmm, so there wouldn't be a way to fix the actual bitmap, or rebuild it?
[13:33] <lotuspsychje> l00p: so you just add a 2nd sata hd, you can format that any way you need from your ubuntu
[13:33] <bekks> sparks_: you can just guess, there is no reliable information on wether it will be cvorrect or not.
[13:33] <lotuspsychje> l00p: disktools or gparted indeed
[13:34] <soLucien> hello guys ! Does anyone know whether Ubuntu comes witha  built-in DHCP server ?
[13:34] <sparks_> hmmmm, I mostly thought it was complaining about the filesystem bitmap because when I run an fsck I get this:
[13:34] <l00p> lotuspsychje: thanks I'll begin to read the manuals for those tools
[13:34] <sparks_> The filesystem size (according to the superblock) is 2930012160 blocks
[13:34] <sparks_> The physical size of the device is 2563760640 blocks
[13:34] <bekks> sparks_: See above.
[13:34] <hateball> soLucien: You can install dhcpd, but it's not preinstalled obviously
[13:34] <sparks_> ah
[13:34] <soLucien> ok , thanks
[13:34] <soLucien> it seems i have dhcpd
[13:35] <hateball> soLucien: you probably want to install isc-dhcp-server and configure it if you are looking to serve dhcp requests
[13:36] <sparks_> bekks, I can see all my files with testdisk, perhaps I should just copy them off the array with that and re-create the file system... only issue is, its 9TB worth of data lol, was hoping a faster resolution
[13:36] <WereCatf> dnsmasq can also serve as a DHCP-server
[13:36] <bekks> sparks_: I assume you have no data worth to be kept then. From what I can read, you have no backup.
[13:37] <sparks_> well, I don't *really* care if I lose it, but I don't always jump to the end conclusion which would be to re-create the filesystem.. I rather expend all other options first
[13:37] <sparks_> but by the sounds of it, I don't have any other options

[13:41] <xubuntu11> hi, i cant access my extern hdd after accidentally removing the usb connection.. what should i do?
[13:41] <xubuntu11> external*
[13:41] <sudosuminus> xubuntu11: is this an i/o error?
[13:42] <hateball> xubuntu11: Is it using NTFS? If you plug it in and then open a terminal and run "dmesg" it probably complains about being marked dirty
[13:42] <xubuntu11> if i plug it in, nothing happens in dmesg
[13:43] <xubuntu11> it was probably noticed and it showed up on thunar but after removing the connection and reconnecting nothing happens
[13:43] <sudosuminus> xubuntu11: I had a problem like that this weekend and after rebooting the hdd read and wrote normally
[13:43] <xubuntu11> i tried that
[13:43] <xubuntu11> :)
[13:44] <xubuntu11> it is really strange, the hdd begins to spin - one can here that - but in dmesg nothing shows up :o
[13:44] <sudosuminus> what filesystem did you say its using?
[13:44] <xubuntu11> it had different partions, nfts and ext4
[13:44] <jophish> How can I upgrade my kernel to 4.2.0-29?
[13:45] <k1l_> jophish: on what ubuntu are you?
[13:45] <jophish> k1l_: Wily
[13:45] <k1l_> jophish: there is no -29 in the stable repos
[13:46] <k1l_> !info linux-image-generic
[13:46] <ubottu> linux-image-generic (source: linux-meta): Generic Linux kernel image. In component main, is optional. Version 4.2.0.27.30 (wily), package size 2 kB, installed size 11 kB
[13:46] <xubuntu11> sudosuminus: it had different partions, nfts and ext4
[13:47] <sudosuminus> xubuntu11: it may be either a hardware problem or a damaged filesystem there are some hdd tools you can try to recover your data
[13:47] <silv3r_m00n> k1l_: now it says isolinux.bin missing or corrupt
[13:48] <xubuntu11> sudosuminus: how could i recover something if it doesnt show up under /dev/ ?
[13:48] <EriC^^> xubuntu11: try a different usb maybe
[13:48] <EriC^^> *usb port
[13:48] <k1l_> silv3r_m00n: how did you create that usb? did you checksum the md5sum of that iso? what iso is that exactly?
[13:49] <silv3r_m00n> k1l_:   ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso
[13:49] <silv3r_m00n> downloaded it with ktorrent
[13:49] <sudosuminus> xubuntu11: DFF is a powerful open source tool with a flexible module system which will help you in your digital forensics works, including files recovery due to error or crash, evidence research and analysis, etc.
[13:49] <sudosuminus> The modules allows you to examine the layout of disk images, devices and other media, to identify partitions, search for files using name, attributes, files magic etc.  Files can also be analyzed or extracted using file analysis modules.

[13:50] <EriC^^> happens a lot
[13:50] <sudosuminus> EriC^^: cheers!
[13:50] <xubuntu11> sudosuminus: thank you too, i checked quickly, no filesystem errors as far as i can see :)

=== d__ is now known as Guest48540
[13:51] <silv3r_m00n> the md5sum is correct
[13:51] <silv3r_m00n> k1l_: this is the command i used, sudo dd if=ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdc1 bs=1M
[13:53] <WereCatf> silv3r_m00n: Use of=/dev/sdc if you're installing it on a USB-stick.
[13:54] <k1l_> silv3r_m00n: yeah, dont use sdc1, use sdc
[13:56] <silv3r_m00n> WereCatf: by the way, i see that pressing ctrl+c does not interrupt the dd command, how do you abort the dd command  ?
[13:56] <silv3r_m00n> and how do you make it display progress ?
[13:57] <WereCatf> silv3r_m00n: ctrl-c does work, it just may take a while to register because it writes out its internal buffers first. If you want to see live-progress I'd recommend using ddrescue instead, but you can make dd spit out its current status by issuing "kill -USR1 pidofddhere" -- obtain dd's pid by looking at the output of "ps aux" first
[13:58] <django_> hey everyone
[13:59] <django_> i have an old version of spotify how can i remove
[13:59] <bekks> django_: Using your package management system, e.g.
[13:59] <k1l_> silv3r_m00n: no need for progress on a 1GB dd.
[14:00] <silv3r_m00n> ok
[14:00] <silv3r_m00n> looks like it worked finally
[14:00] <silv3r_m00n> great thanks
[14:01] <django_> bekks, http://i.imgur.com/N1XIcsI.png
[14:03] <WereCatf> silv3r_m00n: Yeah, your problem was that you were trying to write the image to a partition on the stick, but the image is meant to be written on the beginning on the stick, not under a partition on it. Just keep it in mind in the future and you're all set!

[14:20] <WereCatf> Hm. Installing gnome fixed the missing icons in Cinnamon, but the rendering - issues persist. It's quite broken.
[14:23] <lotuspsychje> WereCatf: wich ubuntu version is this?
[14:23] <WereCatf> 15.10
[14:24] <lotuspsychje> WereCatf: on default ubuntu or mint?
[14:25] <WereCatf> lotuspsychje: fresh install of default Ubuntu 15.10
[14:25] <lotuspsychje> WereCatf: you sure you got the right graphics driver working?
[14:26] <WereCatf> lotuspsychje: running under VMware, so yes, I am quite sure.
[14:26] <lotuspsychje> WereCatf: running cinnamon in vm can be a bottleneck..
[14:26] <WereCatf> lotuspsychje: Hardly. Mint works fine. It's Ubuntu under which Cinnamon is broken.
[14:27] <lotuspsychje> WereCatf: did you try this physical install?
[14:27] <WereCatf> lotuspsychje: No, I have no interest in using Ubuntu on real hardware. I need it inside a VM.
[14:28] <lotuspsychje> WereCatf: try the logs perhaps? see what happens
[14:30] <WereCatf> lotuspsychje: Nothing of much relevant there. The only lines I could imagine being relevant are "Did not find color property '-gradient-start'" and "Did not find color property '-gradient-end'" which would suggest to me that there's still some dependencies broken

[15:13] <EriC^^> it's pretty irrelevant
[15:13] <EriC^^> you're trying to restore the windows efi partition, so they should know more
[15:13] <EriC^^> once you have the files there, you can use grub to boot it etc
[15:14] <EriC^^> most people here won't know about restoring a windows efi, they can help you out way better

[15:16] <andrewSC> hi all
[15:18] <andrewSC> I've run the command `sudo ruby-install ruby 2.2.3` which executed fine, then I added `export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/bin` to my ~/.bashrc, as well as my ~/.bashrc as root. However, when I run `sudo gem install bundler` I get "sudo: gem: command not found" Doing a `which gem` as the user returns the correct path (and if you remove sudo it executes, just can't write to the gems directory). When I do
[15:18] <andrewSC> a `which gem` as root, I also get the correct path. Has anyone experienced this before?
[15:19] <stripe> hi all, clean install of 14.04, on the system monitor the network history is not registering any traffic (either from updates or downloads) any ideas? cheers :-)
[15:19] <AtomicStryker> @EriC^^ thanks, the winner was bcdboot W:\Windows /s B:
[15:20] <andrewSC> Just can't find `gem` when using sudo, even though when I `sudo su -;which gem` it detects the gem path correctly...
[15:20] <AtomicStryker> i actually read the in terminal help
[15:20] <EriC^^> AtomicStryker: cool
[15:20] <EriC^^> update-grub should pick it up now
[15:21] <EriC^^> you could put the files on your ubuntu efi
[15:21] <AtomicStryker> its still broken though, but atleast i have a windows bootloader ... the internet says now i have to keep hitting the "repair boot" option until it works
[15:21] <EriC^^> with that command, unless you plan to use the hdd
[15:22] <EriC^^> AtomicStryker: try just bcdboot X:\Windows

[15:33] <dumle29> So. I was in windows, and i had some pretty bad issues. Steam wouldn't launch, or would be super slow, and games certainly wouldn't start. So I booted in ubuntu, and noticed that one of my drives were missing
[15:34] <dumle29> I took my pc appart, reseated all connectors, and now it's showing up, but S.M.A.R.T. status says that "Disk is OK, one failing attribute is failing" and that attribute is end-to-end-error

[15:34] <dumle29> MonkeyDust: I got the drives showing again, that's not the issue. What I'm wondering, is if it's time to get a new drive on its way?
[15:35] <dumle29> It's on time is 1 year and 2 months
[15:36] <dumle29> I guess google answered :/ This is a critical parameter. Degradation of this parameter may indicate imminent drive failure. Urgent data backup and hardware replacement is recommended.

[16:17] <tsapii> ardiunofan92: from what i figure, xchat is safe but hexchat is better
[16:17] <ardiunofan92> I see, within the software centre hexchat seems to have less reviews
[16:18] <kyle-lauren> Hexchat has more active development
[16:18] <tsapii> maybe because it's newer
[16:18] <rattking> Drac0666: then I think adding '-maxdepth 1' to find should do it.. play around if 1 isnt right
[16:18] <kyle-lauren> Newer, not really. Hexchat is a fork of Xchat, if I recall correctly
[16:18] <kvj1> xangua: ?

[18:15] <SunyataZero> Hi all, i am going to purchase a new laptop computer and am looking at different models, but i'm worried that the wireless network card will not work when i install ubuntu (or lubuntu). I know there's a list of hardward compatible with ubuntu but it doesn't contain the laptops i'm considering, what's the best way you can recommend for finding out if the wifi will work when i run ubuntu? (And how certain can i be that it will work
[18:16] <EriC^^> SunyataZero: maybe get one with a known good chipset that works? just guessing

[18:34] <AtomicStryker> is there a way to strip the "efi" flag off an existing partition without wiping the data
[18:35] <EriC^^> AtomicStryker: yeah, sudo cgdisk /dev/sdX , then change the type
[18:35] <AtomicStryker> thanks, gonna try
[18:36] <jushur> sancho_panza: do a "aplay -l" , to find you card.
[18:36] <isaac_> hi everybody
[18:37] <jushur> sancho_panza: some cards have issues if your onboard soundcard is enabled at the same time. and you may need to block modules to stop it from loading.
[18:37] <isaac_> someone is in mwc at @bcn ?
[18:37] <sancho_panza> my card works fine with audacity
[18:38] <sancho_panza> also works on KX Studio with cadence
[18:39] <jushur> sancho_panza: create the ~/.asoundrc and set your card as default then.
[18:39] <[[thufir]]> which do you install first, postfix or mail-stack-delivery?  this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/postfix.html  says first postfix, then mail-stack-delivery.  However, I'm running 15.10, wily.  Where is the guide for version 15.10 relating to these packages?
[18:40] <AtomicStryker> oh, uh, when i unflagged it "boot" it autoflagged as msftdata
[18:40] <jushur> sancho_panza: im away now, you can write stuff to me but ill not be answering for about 4h.
[18:40] <AtomicStryker> which flags is a windows os partition supposed to have
[18:40] <sancho_panza> .asoundrc is a file?
[18:40] <sancho_panza> ok ty

[19:06] <reisio> Guy1524_: which version added vulkan support
[19:07] <Guy1524_> I don't know ):
[19:07] <Guy1524_> I looked into the current github glfw3.h which had vulkan functions but my glfw3.h doesn't have them
[19:07] <Guy1524_> but I heard it was added a while ago
[19:07] <nick420> hello?
[19:08] <reisio> nick420: 'lo
[19:08] <MonkeyDust> Guy1524_  ppa's are not supported here, i guess you're on your own
[19:08] <reisio> Guy1524_: should find out what version added it
[19:08] <reisio> Guy1524_: then you'll know what your choices are
[19:08] <Guy1524_> ok
[19:08] <nick420> ive never done this so its new to me but i need some help
[19:08] <reisio> nick420: this is a place for help
[19:09] <nick420> im having trouble with getting/installing java
[19:09] <reisio> what do you want java for
[19:10] <Guy1524_> it is nowhere in the changelog http://www.glfw.org/changelog.html
[19:10] <reisio> Guy1524_: you can find it in the git history
[19:10] <Guy1524_> ok
[19:10] <nick420> a friend switched my computer to ubuntu and put minecraft but it doesnt work
[19:10] <Guy1524_> is there a way to see what commit a function was added
[19:11] <reisio> nick420: what's it say when you run it?
[19:11] <silvian> Hi nick420: What is your java issue?
[19:11] <Guy1524_> sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webup8team/java && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install java8-installer
[19:11] <silvian> which JRE/JDK are you trying to install?
[19:11] <reisio> Guy1524_: git bisect, though it might be more than you want to learn just now
[19:11] <Guy1524_> sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install java8-installer
[19:11] <Guy1524_> sorry
[19:12] <Guy1524_> I accidentally pasted it again
[19:12] <nick420> it says i need java runtime enviorment
[19:12] <Guy1524_> nick420: just run the command I sent you, it should install it
[19:12] <silvian> yes you need to download java as Guy1524_ recommended
[19:13] <Guy1524_> basically there are two versions of java, the open source, somewhat slower version, and the oracle provided version, I sent you the oracle way since its faster
[19:13] <nick420> Cannot add PPA: 'ppa:webup8team/java'. Please check that the PPA name or format is correct.
[19:13] <Guy1524_> that was a type

[19:17] <silvian> @nick420: try the following
[19:18] <silvian> sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre
[19:18] <nick420> does anybody else have any suggestions for my java issue
[19:18] <EriC^^> no problem
[19:18] <silvian> and then try installing jdk as well
[19:18] <silvian> sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
[19:18] <silvian> which ubuntu version have you got installed?
[19:19] <nick420> 14.04 i think
[19:19] <nick420> im very new to it
[19:20] <silvian> ok did that work?
[19:21] <patarr> hello. Why is it that when I have a txt file with packages (line by line) it does not work with sudo apt-get install $(cat packages.txt) ?
[19:21] <nick420> well it seems to download everything properly but it still promts me the same thing when i try to open the game
[19:21] <franendar_> any idea how to get a specific glibc version?
[19:21] <nick420> could it be the game?
[19:22] <patarr> It gives me an error E: Unable to locate package x for lots of packages that I know exist. I can even just install them manually with install "package"
[19:22] <EriC^^> patarr: what does it say?
[19:22] <silvian> what is teh verion of minecraft you're running?
[19:22] <EriC^^> can you paste the file?
[19:22] <silvian> it probably requires java 8
[19:22] <silvian> version
[19:22] <silvian> i can't spell today it seems :P
[19:23] <patarr> EriC^^, it's libreoffice, build-essential, tmux, vim on separate lines.
[19:23] <nick420> im not even sure. i cant open it and my friend put it on here
[19:24] <wellick> I opened Vi on Ubuntu but it doesn't let me type...
[19:24] <EriC^^> patarr: oh, it won't work on separate lines, try xargs -a /file sudo apt-get install instead
[19:24] <silvian> right lets try installing oracle's java 8
[19:24] <Pici> wellick: do you know how to use vi?
[19:24] <silvian> it might help...
[19:25] <nick420> thanx for ur patience
[19:25] <maho> How do I go about using GNU make?
[19:25] <patarr> EriC^^, this SO answer says it should work both ways :( I also tried the xargs command in there. I will try yours as well http://askubuntu.com/questions/541781/install-list-of-packages-using-apt-get
[19:25] <silvian> rung the following furst
[19:25] <silvian> first
[19:25] <silvian> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
[19:25] <silvian> does it add it successfully?
[19:25] <patarr> EriC^^, same issue with your command :(
[19:26] <wellick> Pici: I just want to write some simple code and exit. it might as well be notepad.
[19:26] <EriC^^> patarr: something else is wrong
[19:26] <nick420> Important!!! For now, you should continue to use Java 8 because Oracle Java 9 is available as an early access release (it should be released in 2016)! You should only use Oracle Java 9 if you explicitly need it, because it may contain bugs and it might not include the latest security patches!
[19:26] <reisio> icedtea should really work
[19:26] <EriC^^> patarr: btw i think they meant $(cat pkglist) only works if you have them side by side, and xargs for the other
[19:27] <Pici> wellick: you may want to use nano instead.  vi/vim require reading some tutorial (or going through vimtutor) prior to editing.
[19:27] <silvian> yeah i gave you the ppa for java 8
[19:27] <silvian> :)
[19:27] <silvian> has it added it to the ppa list?
[19:27] <nick420> ok. seems good
[19:27] <silvian> ok
[19:27] <patarr> EriC^^, I tried both - but I think I found the issue. Line endings. I made the file on windows. Wrote the file again in vim on the OS, and it seems to work.
[19:27] <silvian> now do
[19:27] <silvian> sudo apt-get update
[19:27] <patarr> Damn line endings.
[19:27] <EriC^^> oh
[19:27] <silvian> to refresh your ppa library
[19:28] <nick420> ok done
[19:28] <silvian> good now run
[19:28] <silvian> sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
[19:29] <wellick> Pici: ok, thanks
[19:32] <nick420> going to take a few minutes
[19:34] <travisthenavi> I recently changed my OS to Xubuntu Linux (14.04 LTS). I want to download the LAMP stack for web development. Should I install PHP and MySQL seperately, or just install the whole stack as one package?
[19:34] <silvian> @nick420: sure... sounds like you're the right track anyway
[19:35] <silvian> after that's finished doing everything
[19:35] <silvian> run java --version
[19:35] <Hakon> hello. I'm trying to figure out a problem with idmapd where it takes quite a while for it to resolve username and group for folders over nfs4. If i just signed into the machine then the folders have 4294967294 for 3-4 minutes or so before changing to the correct value. has anyone experienced this?
[19:35] <silvian> to confirm you got java 1.8 installed :)
[19:35] <MonkeyDust> travisthenavi  the MP means Mysql and PHP
[19:35] <travisthenavi> Yeah, I also will need Apache. I forgot.
[19:35] <SchrodingersScat> travisthenavi: is there even a virtual package for 'lamp'?
[19:46] <tsapii> you could find it using `which`
[19:46] <tgm4883> nick420: you're just trying to play minecraft? How did you install java?
[19:46] <tsapii> e.g. for me, `which java` produces /usr/bin/java
[19:47] <tgm4883> silvian: tell me to go away if you've got this covered :)
[19:47] <tsapii> which is a symlink to /etc/alternatives/java, which in turn is a symlink to /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java
[19:47] <nick420> not that i see anywhere no
[19:47] <datamancer_> Hi all. How can I update Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 to 14.04.4?
[19:47] <silvian> no worries :) your help is appreciated
[19:47] <silvian> yeah try typing which java
[19:47] <tgm4883> datamancer_: you get it via regular apt updates
[19:47] <silvian> it might installed somewhere else
[19:47] <silvian> usually its /usr/lib
[19:47] <tsapii> readlink -f `which java` should reveal its path
[19:47] <datamancer_> tgm4883: Right, thanks, but I'm a bit confused as to which command to run to do it. Is it apt-get upgrade?
=== dearn_ is now known as dearn
[19:47] <tgm4883> datamancer_: yes
[19:47] <datamancer_> tgm4883: tyvm :)
[19:47] <Bashing-om> datamancer_: " sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade ; sudo apt full-upgrade " should be all there is to it .
[19:48] <latenite_> Hi folks, how can I determine when the latest firefox update was available for update?
[19:48] <dragonbite> If all you are doing is Minecraft, openjdk-7-jre also works and it is in the repos.
[19:48] <sethj> when it *was* or when it *will be*?
[19:48] <silvian> @nick420: try typing this
[19:48] <silvian> readlink -f `which java`
[19:48] <Andocromn> i'm working on an Ubuntu Remix live cd, i have it mostly working except on bootup i get a number of authentication failure messages and no console or login prompt.  does anyone know how to fix this?
[19:48] <silvian> it should reveal exact path as tsapii suggested
[19:48] <silvian> so we can add it to your java home
[19:49] <debug0x1> http://www.meetup.com/HackerNestNYC/events/227143576/
[19:49] <tgm4883> nick420: How did you install java? And is this openjdk? All I needed to do was install openjdk-8-jre and then run the jar
[19:49] <tgm4883> (although technically, I run it through multimc since I like lots of mods)
[19:49] <silvian> no its oracle's. We had no luck getting minecraft working with open jdk
[19:49] <xangua> latenite_: check Firefox releases notes? Wikipedia history release?
[19:49] <dragonbite> can run using "java -jar <path to>/Minecraft.jar
[19:49] <nick420> silvian gave me a walk through and all seemed to work but the game will still not open
[19:49] <silvian> had to install oracle jdk for him
[19:50] <dragonbite> sorry, "java -jar <path to>/Minecraft.jar" (without quotes)
[19:50] <latenite_> xangua, I mean when it made its way to ubuntu.
[19:50] <tgm4883> silvian: was there an error? What version of minecraft? It should work fine with openjdk
[19:50] <silvian> yeah that's what i though... no nick420 didn't specify the error
[19:50] <latenite_> xangua, I want to compare the release dates of the offical sites of firefox to the dates of some distros
[19:50] <silvian> anyway should be there configuring this... we just need to set $JAVA_HOME environment variable
[19:51] <silvian> so I've asked nick420 to run: readlink -f `which java`
[19:51] <silvian> to find out what the install path is
[19:51] <dragonbite> silvian: what about trying to uninstall it and then install openjdk or oracle java again?
[19:52]  * tgm4883 wonders if it's not a java issue...
[19:52] <silvian> its installed fine i think its just a matter of configuring JAVA_HOME now
[19:52] <nick420> it says this /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java
[19:52] <silvian> good ok now copy that exactly into your clipboard
[19:52] <silvian> and now run export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java
[19:52] <latenite_> anyone? I don't use ubuntu and could really use some help here :D
[19:53] <nick420> clipboard..? lol
[19:53] <silvian> whatever... ctrl +C
[19:53] <silvian> :P
[19:53] <Bashing-om> latenite_: Then there is a need for you to run ubuntu .
[19:53] <silvian> just paste this and run it
[19:53] <silvian> export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java
[19:53] <tgm4883> latenite_: why?
[19:54] <latenite_> Bashing-om, I was hoping to find the data I need online in the repos or some git...
[19:54] <nick420> i pasted "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java" and nothing happend
[19:54] <latenite_> tgm4883, so I can compare how fast/slow software updates get into the different distros.
[19:54] <dragonbite> latenite: have you looked at http://packages.ubuntu.com ?  It doesn't give you the date but gives you the version
[19:55] <tsapii> nick420: you specified the java binary as JAVA_HOME
[19:55] <tsapii> remove the "bin/java" part
[19:55] <Bashing-om> latenite_: You can always ask, if it is not ubuntu related we can redirect so you get the help you need . Ask your question .
[19:55] <silvian> that's fine
[19:55] <silvian> it gives you no output back
[19:55] <latenite_> Bashing-om, tgm4883 xangua on gentoo it was easy for firefox https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/www-client/firefox/firefox-44.0.2.ebuild?id=2b761e9d635fee7a8c3ab20dfa54e20c0c1d737c
[19:55] <silvian> just hit return key
[19:55] <latenite_> 3 days
[19:55] <tgm4883> latenite_: you'd need to go through the mailing list to get the upload dates I believe
[19:55] <silvian> then close down your terminal
[19:55] <silvian> and open it again
[19:55] <silvian> then try running minecraft
[19:55] <silvian> it should be set now
[19:56] <tsapii> …is it fine to specify it to the binary path? could've sworn that it had to be left out
[19:56] <ks3> latenite_: If you're looking in the repos why couldn't you use the timestamp of the package?
[19:56] <latenite_> tgm4883, there is no logging or git? When it comes to ubuntu repos?
[19:56] <tgm4883> latenite_: what ks3 said. That seems to be the best solution http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/firefox/
[19:57] <latenite_> ks3, I found this file http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/wily/main/binary-amd64/
[19:57] <latenite_> but there are not time stamps
[19:57] <tgm4883> latenite_: look at the link I posted
[19:57] <nick420> negative. says the same thing :(
[19:57] <nick420> should i give up lol
[19:58] <tgm4883> silvian: closing and reopening the terminal wipes the export
[19:58] <tsapii> yeah
[19:58] <tsapii> should add it to .bashrc
[19:58] <tgm4883> well, should export it first and see if it works
[19:59] <tgm4883> only add it to .bashrc if it works
[19:59] <tsapii> true
[19:59] <silvian> yeah repeat the export task again in bash terminal
[20:00] <tgm4883> silvian: also, you set his java_home wrong
[20:00] <latenite_> tgm4883, so http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/firefox/firefox-dbg_44.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.15.10.1_amd64.deb is from 11-Feb-2016 20:39
[20:00] <nick420> export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   ??
[20:00] <tgm4883> nick420: no
[20:00] <latenite_> tgm4883, I wonder if there is a TIME on the offical release by mozilla?!
[20:00] <tgm4883> nick420: "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre"
[20:01] <tgm4883> latenite_: what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? Because it doesn't really seem like a support issue
[20:02] <latenite_> tgm4883, it's about getting to know how much time passed from mozillas offical release until available in ubuntu15
[20:02] <tgm4883> latenite_: but why
=== al2o3-cr is now known as Guest15322
[20:02] <nick420> ok i did that tmg4883. nothing happend
[20:02] <nick420> blank line now
[20:02] <tgm4883> nick420: ok, now do
[20:03] <tgm4883> nick420: 'java -jar <path to minecraft.jar file>
[20:03] <latenite_> tgm4883, to compare to other distros. There seem to be big differences in time...
[20:03] <tgm4883> I'm assuming it's just minecraft.jar
[20:03] <nick420> ok..another blank line
[20:03] <tgm4883> latenite_: which is worthless IMO and doesn't make me want to drop what I'm doing to help you
[20:04] <tgm4883> nick420: can you do 'ls -l' then pastebin what you've done in the terminal so far?
[20:04] <nick420> nick@enterprise:~$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java nick@enterprise:~$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre" > 'java -jar <path to minecraft.jar file> > 'ls -l'
[20:05] <tgm4883> latenite_: honestly though, what's your end game here?
[20:05] <tgm4883> nick420: do 'ctrl+c'
[20:05] <latenite_> tgm4883, it sparked a discussion in our LUG ... So I am investigating on it. The whole idea started with this: http://segfault.linuxmint.com/2013/11/answering-controversy-stability-vs-security-is-something-you-configure/
[20:05] <nick420> ok
=== al2o3-cr1 is now known as al2o3-cr
=== AndyTechGuy is now known as _atg
[20:06] <tgm4883> latenite_: yea, that's about what I figured started this....
[20:06] <tgm4883> nick420: ok, now do "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre" but remember to remove both quotes
[20:06] <latenite_> tgm4883, our members wonder what the real difference is, when it comes to time and updates
=== jwheare_local___ is now known as jwheare_local
[20:07] <tgm4883> latenite_: ok, so I would probably forget about the timestamp then and just focus on the date
[20:07] <nick420> ok i did that
[20:07] <silvian> still no luck guys with java home?
[20:07] <tgm4883> latenite_: 1) because you're talking times, but unsure about what timezone the server is in
[20:07] <latenite_> true , good point
[20:07] <tgm4883> latenite_: and 2) we're talking hours here, which is meaningless
[20:07] <tgm4883> nick420: ok, now do this
[20:08] <tgm4883> nick420: 'java -jar minecraft.jar'
[20:08] <Pici> latenite_: I missed part of the conversation here, but are you looking for something like this? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+publishinghistory
[20:08] <nick420> with the quotes?
[20:08] <tgm4883> latenite_: ^^
[20:08] <tgm4883> nick420: no, remove the quotes
[20:08] <silvian> no quotes
[20:09] <tgm4883> Pici: that is perfect, exactly what he's looking for
[20:09] <tgm4883> and way better than what I gave him
[20:09] <nick420> Error: Unable to access jarfile minecraft.jar
[20:09] <latenite_> Pici, great
[20:09] <Pici> :)
[20:09] <latenite_> tgm4883, so its UTC :D
[20:09] <tgm4883> nick420: ok, can you pastebin this command 'ls -l'
[20:09] <latenite_> we can start being picky about hours now :D
[20:09] <nick420> im gonna lay a steamer on this thing soon
[20:10] <tgm4883> nick420: we're getting close I think
[20:10] <silvian> :)
[20:10] <nick420> ok i did that
[20:10] <tgm4883> nick420: what's the output?

[20:11] <nick420> oops sorry guys
[20:11] <tgm4883> nick420: ok, where is your minecraft jar file?
[20:11] <nick420> that seems like a really valid question..
[20:12] <nick420> and suggestions lol
[20:12] <tgm4883> nick420: my assumption is it's still in your Downloads folder
[20:12] <nick420> yes it is
[20:12]  * tgm4883 is seriously doubting the openjdk issue now
[20:12] <tgm4883> nick420: ok do this
[20:12] <tgm4883> nick420: 'cd Downloads'
[20:12] <tgm4883> nick420: without the quotes
[20:13] <tgm4883> also, this is possibly the most difficult way we could do this, but I digress
[20:13] <nick420> check
[20:13] <tgm4883> nick420: ok, now do
[20:13] <tgm4883> nick420: 'java -jar minecraft.jar'
[20:13] <tgm4883> nick420: no quotes
[20:13]  * tgm4883 shoots silvian an evil eye
[20:14] <nick420> ok
[20:14] <Ian_Corne> what's the "good" way to get fingerprint readers in ubuntu?
[20:14] <silvian> have you found the minecraft.jar file?
[20:14] <tgm4883> nick420: ok what happened?
[20:14] <Ian_Corne> some program i need to install, or is it already preinstalled and I just need to set it up?
[20:14] <silvian> thanks for jumping in tgm4883
[20:14] <silvian> :)
[20:14] <tgm4883> silvian: it's supposedly in Downloads/
[20:14] <tgm4883> although I didn't verify filename/case :/
[20:14] <silvian> I think nick420 is playing right now ;)
[20:15] <nick420> nick@enterprise:~$ cd Downloads nick@enterprise:~/Downloads$ java -jar minecraft.jar Error: Unable to access jarfile minecraft.jar nick@enterprise:~/Downloads$
[20:15] <silvian> oh permissions
[20:15] <nick420> i wish silvian. i really do
[20:15] <tsapii> wasn't it Minecraft.jar just before?
[20:15] <silvian> do ls -lrt
[20:15] <tgm4883> tsapii: yea it is
[20:15] <silvian> inside Downloads
[20:15] <tgm4883> nick420: 'java -jar Minecraft.jar'
[20:15] <silvian> paste the output
