[02:53] <oppositescopez> KI7MT: i got "system program problem detected" just now
[02:53] <oppositescopez> kostkon: haha i have 4 hard drives 1 windows 1 lubuntu 2 for 110 gigs of extra storage
[02:54] <legend123> kostkon: You are right. That usb warning is related to a external hard drive when i safely remove it. Xorg logs seem normal to me except some errors starting at line number 324. Have a look at this, http://paste.ubuntu.com/6095289/
[02:54] <oppositescopez> kostkon: ill just copy it to my extra storage
[02:54] <kostkon> oppositescopez, yeap. you can even extra the file if needed be, if you install 7zip in ubuntu
[02:54] <kostkon> extract*
[02:55] <oppositescopez> kostkon:  oh ok thanks :)

[02:56] <kostkon> legend123, everything looks fine, i think
[02:56] <KI7MT> oppositescopez, to stop getting those msg's: gksudo gedit /etc/default/apport and change the text "enabled=1" to "enabled-0"
[02:57] <oppositescopez> you mean enabled = 0?
[02:57] <KI7MT> However, that disables all msg's so if you wont get any msg's then
[02:58] <oppositescopez> dont need them
[02:58] <KI7MT> 1=Yes I want them, and 0=No, dont bug me with that noise.

[03:08] <KI7MT> oppositescopez, while Java may be a solution to some it's the root of many prob's for others :-)
[03:08] <oppositescopez> KI7MT: been there, done that
[03:09] <oppositescopez> KI7MT: actualy ran iced tea i think it was? for the longest time

[03:18] <karen_> Does anyone have any idea on how to share a hard drive between two computer that are 30 ft away with out spending more then $300?
[03:18] <ClumsyFairyQueen> karen_, check workgroup and if other computer ispingable
[03:18] <oppositescopez> KI7MT:  apparently i still have iced tea but its disabled
[03:18] <ClumsyFairyQueen> if workgroup is not the same on both computers, it wont work.
[03:18] <karen_> nothing is ping about. they do not see each other. I hate them both.
[03:18] <KI7MT> That's probably a good thing :-)

[03:25] <oppositescopez> should i try update again before reboot like you said earlier?
[03:26] <KI7MT> No we'll do that after re-boot.
[03:26] <oppositescopez> oh my software updater showed up before i did that. isnt that what i just did? should i just close it?
[03:26] <rscnt> hi
=== sandyd is now known as ClumsyFairyQueen
[03:27] <oppositescopez> KI7MT:  or did i just o something else?
[03:27] <KI7MT> Yes, close the updater window, shutdown -r
[03:27] <oppositescopez> k
[03:28] <KI7MT> the updater was catching up from when  we unhung the Chromium stuff.
[03:28] <oppositescopez> yeah
[03:28] <oppositescopez> btw that shutdown command failed :p
[03:28] <oppositescopez> Try `shutdown --help' for more information.
[03:28] <oppositescopez> haha
[03:28] <krux> shutdown -h now
[03:29] <oppositescopez> same result
[03:29] <KI7MT> LOL it wasnt' a command, proper command is: sudo shutdown -r now
[03:29] <oppositescopez> oh whoops
[03:29] <oppositescopez> :P
[03:33] <oppositescopez_> im back
[03:33] <oppositescopez_> hating now that i have this theme removed
[03:33] <oppositescopez_> it just updated
[03:33] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT: so update again?
[03:34] <oppositescopez_> hello?
[03:35] <oppositescopez_> did i break this again ~.~
[03:35] <ClumsyFairyQueen> oppositescopez_, btw, what problem are you having - cant see what it is since my server decided to go into a RAID rebuild
[03:35] <KI7MT> Yeah, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[03:35] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT:  i cant see the time in the bottom left any more (just throwing that out there)
[03:36] <KI7MT> oppositescopez_, Im compilign code in xterm also, so dont ahve this up all the time.
[03:36] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT:  yeah sorry i just didnt know if this had stopped working again
[03:36] <KI7MT> Yep, Lubuntu bottom bar has issues, things disappear, get hung up, all sorts of things.
[03:36] <chucho> hi all. looking for recommendations for visualizing a tcpdump pcap capture file
[03:36] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT:  found the problem
[03:37] <KI7MT> with what the clock ?
[03:37] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT:  do you happen to know the color code format for it?
[03:37] <KI7MT> or the main problem
[03:37] <oppositescopez_> yeah
[03:37] <oppositescopez_> clock
[03:37] <KI7MT> color-code = No, pass on that one.
[03:38] <KI7MT> I've not spent that much time in Lub.
[03:38] <KI7MT> I test the installs for UB QA, but that's about it.
[03:38] <ClumsyFairyQueen> chucho, wireshark
[03:38] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT:  know an alternative ?
[03:39] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT:  got an error at the end of upgrade http://paste.ubuntu.com/6095416/
[03:39] <chucho> ClumsyFairyQueen , thats what im trying rigth now. Was looking for any other alternatives with more visualization options
[03:40] <ClumsyFairyQueen> chucho, tnv maybe
[03:40] <ClumsyFairyQueen> http://tnv.sourceforge.net/
[03:41] <chucho> for some reason tnv doesnt display anything after "import pcap file"
[03:41] <DaphneGreengrass> sorry, those are the only two I normally use :|
[03:42] <KI7MT> oppositescopez_, Alternative to what? ?    man this apparmor is a pain, as is this silly Chromium browser.
[03:42] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT:  an alternative clock :P
[03:42] <oppositescopez_> KI7MT:  apparently you cant change the colors
[03:43] <jrib> KI7MT, oppositescopez_: actually, this is probably due to whatever /usr/bin/start is.
[03:43] <jrib> KI7MT, oppositescopez_: because "start" probably should be /sbin/start
[03:43] <oppositescopez_> that actualy just started showing up
[03:43] <oppositescopez_> the /usr/bin
[03:44] <oppositescopez_> JESUS
[03:44] <jrib> oppositescopez_: what *is* it?
[03:44] <oppositescopez_> everything just broke
[03:44] <oppositescopez_> uhh im just gonna leave my toolbar alone x.x
[03:45] <oppositescopez_> and the directory usr/bin just started showing up after i deleted chrome
[03:45] <KI7MT> Good Plan, fix one issue at a time :-)
[03:45] <oppositescopez_> i just got like a broken screen with alot of system problems once i removed clock o.0
[03:46] <oppositescopez_> ok ill look at that
[03:46] <DaphneGreengrass> oppositescopez_, you should have seen when i removed networkmanager.... :D
[03:46] <KI7MT> I thinks it's getting on the apparmor profile, and it needs to be updated but I'm just not sure.
[03:47] <oppositescopez_> found the problem, know whats causing it, feel like an idiot!!!!!
[03:48] <oppositescopez_> let me give advise to ALL ubuntu users in the ENTIRE world
[03:48] <oppositescopez_> NEVER< EVER, EVER, install modio through terminal -.- just dont
[03:49] <oppositescopez_> i did that and i thouroughly remember being redirected to porn. multiple times. never know why. its cause it created this file  when i sudo-apt get installed modio http://paste.ubuntu.com/6095429/
[03:50] <oppositescopez_> and this has been trying to run every time i installed anything
[03:50] <oppositescopez_> but because i use  "sudo" to install it wouldnt run the chromes in that file
[03:50] <KI7MT> Hmmmm to much *orn surfing :-)
[03:51] <KI7MT> I was thinking the Chromium profile was m,issing, and that is why it kept hanging, was about to write a Bug up on it :-)
[03:51] <wilee-nilee> oppositescopez_, This is a family channel do not post stuff like that.
[03:51] <oppositescopez_> whoops
[03:52] <oppositescopez_> it was advise to never use modio. completely related :p
[03:52] <oppositescopez_> but it wont happen again ~.~
[03:52] <KI7MT> Ok, so you removed modio .. and then what?
[03:53] <oppositescopez_> haha no all i have to do is delete that file.
[03:53] <KI7MT> Ahh .. ok . then you can update without getting the rsyslog and chromium errors ?
[03:53] <oppositescopez_> i never actualy got around to removing i ti just stopped using it
[03:53] <oppositescopez_> about to find out
[03:54] <KI7MT> kk
[03:54] <oppositescopez_> yep ^_^
[03:55] <KI7MT> So, no errors now ?
[03:55] <oppositescopez_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6095438/ see for yourself
[03:55] <LinuxGold> rm -rf start?!
[03:56] <LinuxGold> whoa...
[03:56] <oppositescopez_> haha :p
[03:56] <KI7MT> YOu shoudl probablt do an autoremove and autoclean also: sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean
[03:56] <KI7MT> should probably ..
[03:57] <KI7MT> then update, upgrade and then sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
[03:58] <oppositescopez_> haha now i can continue the only reason i wanted this error to go away :D
[03:58] <oppositescopez_> trying to get league of legends to run on linux ;D
[03:59] <KI7MT> That's not hard, apparmor is hard ;'-)
[03:59] <oppositescopez_> so this does mean no more errors right?
[04:00] <sqlnoob> I'm trying to change my motd however my changes to /var/run/motd does not become permanent. I'm not trying to install update-motd but trying to do manually. Is there something I'm missing?
[04:00] <KI7MT> oppositescopez_, Yeah, your all sorted, do the updates, then, re-install chromium
[04:01] <oppositescopez_> wow only took all day
[04:01] <KI7MT> My advise, go through the GUI package manager, Synaptic or Ubuntu SW Center.
[04:01] <oppositescopez_> but why would modio do something like that?
[04:01] <KI7MT> command-line is good, but one can get into deep-woods in a hurry.
[04:02] <KI7MT> Without looking at the Modio source code, there's no telling why, I would "NOT" re-install it.
[04:03] <oppositescopez_> not planning on it x.x
[04:03]  * LinuxGold is running Ubuntu desktop inside iMac
[04:03] <KI7MT> Ok, im back to glibc and binutils compiling :-)
[04:04] <oppositescopez_> haha ok, im off to continue doind... well .. whatever it is that i do :p

[05:03] <Alvein> hi all
[05:03] <Alvein> how to stress test to ethernet card ?
[05:04] <Dr_Willis> load a bunch of torrents ;)
[05:05] <arctanx> Hi there, I'm trying to create a samba audit file by logging to local5. When I add an rsyslog conf "local5.notice /var/log/samba/audit.log" then "& ~" on the next line, it does stop the messages appearing in /var/log/syslog. Unfortunately audit.log is created but has no content. Could anyone please give me a pointer?
[05:06] <Alvein> Dr_Willis, :) I have the server periodically lost touch with the outside world, I want to find the reason, I think the iron .. Torrent will not help :)
[05:06] <Alvein> iron=hardware )
[05:07] <Dr_Willis> Alvein:  its likely the dmesg messges will mention if theres some sort of hardware issue going on with the netsork card
[05:07] <clue_h> If you stress test it you may overwrite important info in logs that may have told you about the drop
[05:08] <clue_h> or increase the haystack
[05:08] <Alvein> dmesg | grep eth is empty :)
[05:08] <Konigsberg7> I got 12.04 non LTS
[05:08] <Dr_Willis> monitor it for a few days perhaps
[05:09] <Konigsberg7>  is there still support on 12.04 not LTS
[05:09] <Konigsberg7> non*
[05:09] <Dr_Willis> !12.04
[05:09] <ubottu> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) is the current !LTS release of Ubuntu.  Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1204
[05:09] <Alvein> Dr_Willis, this problem since Monday
[05:09] <Alvein> :)
[05:09] <Dr_Willis> how do you get 12.04 nonlts ?
[05:09] <clue_h> I was thinking the same.
[05:09] <wilee-nilee> Konigsberg7, if it's canonical you have lts
[05:10] <Konigsberg7>  i dont have lts, i have 12.04 regular xubuntu
[05:10] <Konigsberg7>  as in regular meaning non-lts
[05:10] <Dr_Willis> then you should just say you hve Xubuntu 12.04
[05:10] <Dr_Willis> and you should just ask the question
[05:10] <Dr_Willis> lts dosent really mean a whole lot for most people/cases
[05:10] <Konigsberg7> alright, I have Xubuntu 12.04 (non LTS), is still updates still coming to it or is it done?
[05:11] <Dr_Willis> Konigsberg7:  it still has updates as far as i know.
[05:11] <Dr_Willis> its not like a bug fix in  for the lts supported packages will see you are on xubuntu and refuse to install
[05:11] <Dr_Willis> i think you are worring way to much about lts/nonlts
[05:12] <Dr_Willis> install ubuntu 12.04.4 or whatever and install xubuntu-desktop package if you want to.
[05:12] <Konigsberg7> no i was just wondering
[05:13] <Konigsberg7> i dont care if support ends or not, i was just curious if it did
[05:13] <Dr_Willis> lts is mainly support for a core set of packages for security fixs
[05:13] <Dr_Willis> and with 12.04 they have sprt of expaneded it a little bit to include a few other things.
[05:13] <Juiffi> hello!
[05:13] <Dr_Willis> 12.04.4 for example has updted kernel and  the X stack i belive
[05:14] <Juiffi> So, after some problems I got my system to run. The C1E support was broken, probably by the mobo
[05:14] <Juiffi> now everythin is stable
[05:15] <Juiffi> but Wolf:ET is annoying me
[05:15] <Juiffi> there is no sound
[05:15] <Juiffi> no matter what I do
[05:15] <Dr_Willis> thats not supriseding
[05:15] <Dr_Willis> that game is ancient. :)
[05:15] <Juiffi> "echo "et.x86 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss"
[05:15] <Dr_Willis> i rember sound issues with it like years and years ago.
[05:16] <Juiffi> returns just No such file or directory
[05:16] <Juiffi> Yep, but we still throw LAN-parties and it's an all-time favourite
[05:16] <Dr_Willis> could be the oss support backwards support has finally been removed
[05:17] <Juiffi> well, that pretty much does it then?
[05:17] <Juiffi> it's beyond fix?
[05:17] <Juiffi> FUBAR?
[05:17] <Dr_Willis> i dont have that file here. but i am on 13.10
[05:18] <Juiffi> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnemyTerritory#Sound_Issues I've been following this
[05:18] <shajeen> is ubuntu 14.0 released?
[05:18] <Juiffi> pretty much all I could do is done
[05:18] <Dr_Willis> and how old is that guide? ;)
[05:18] <Juiffi> no idea

[05:22] <Juiffi> yep
[05:22] <Juiffi> will try ->
[05:22] <Dr_Willis> 'aoss command'
[05:23]  * Dr_Willis is just hitting up google and the forums and askubuntu.com - no idea of any of this works
[05:23] <Juiffi> Still broken
[05:23] <Dr_Willis> at least some of these tips are dated in 2012 ;) so are not 5+ yr old guides

[05:24] <Juiffi> aoss et?
[05:25] <Dr_Willis> you are asking me? I dont know wht you ran. Heh,   been literally 5+ years since i last ran ET
[05:25] <Dr_Willis> i thought there was a remake of it that used the data files but had a more mondern engine
[05:26] <Dr_Willis> you were doing those echo commands as root?
[05:27] <Juiffi> sudo -i does the trick I presume?

[05:31] <Dr_Willis> yep. seen several guides say the ones from Getdeb worked
[05:40] <Juiffi> Lol, maybe I should actually keep up with the progress
[05:40] <Juiffi> just added playdeb repo and apt-get install enemy-territory
[05:40] <Juiffi> all woks
[05:40] <Juiffi> I'm gettin too old
[05:41] <Juiffi> *work
[05:43] <ackpacket> Is there a difference between putting the ubuntu dvd on a usb, and running the "live cd" option, vs actually installing ubuntu to the usb?
[05:43] <Dr_Willis> you can do a live-usb setup  which is the dvd on usb + a peristant save file.
[05:44] <ackpacket> is there a speed difference?
[05:44] <Dr_Willis> OR do a full install to a usb flash drive. like you would to a hard drive
[05:44] <ackpacket> right, those are the two options I am examining
[05:44] <Dr_Willis> a USB should be faster then a dvd i imagine
[05:44] <Dr_Willis> I do full installs to USB all the time.
[05:44] <ackpacket> Mine usually fail miserably
[05:44] <Juiffi> I'd put my money on Full install on USB
[05:44] <Dr_Willis> a live+persistant save - is more for testing/short term ussage
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> ive never had a full install on usb fail on me,
[05:45] <ackpacket> It's always something
[05:45] <ackpacket> always
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> ive definatly had live+peristant - have all sorts of weirdness
[05:45] <wilee-nilee> me neither
[05:45] <ackpacket> for instance, once when doing a full install, I was able to select the usb drive at some point
[05:45] <ackpacket> but when it came to the bootloader, it only gave me the option of applying it to my computer's actual HD
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> you can only do so many changes/updates to the persistant save befor it gets goofed up.
[05:46] <ackpacket> another time, the install went smoothly, but when trying to start the OS, it would always freeze
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> the pull down menu for me almost always showe the proper usb drive these days
[05:46] <wilee-nilee> ackpacket, Are you familiar with using the dropdown in the manual option?
[05:46] <ackpacket> wilee-nilee: no
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> i always use the 'manual' partioning  snce i want to make the swap partion  512mb in size in most cases
[05:47] <ackpacket> tbh, I'm unfamiliar with linux on the whole, so I don't even grasp the importance of the various partitions
[05:47] <Dr_Willis> i often make a /boot/ partition because i set up the usb to also boot the ISO files just in case ;)
[05:47] <wilee-nilee> ackpacket, ah, that is important for placing grub.
[05:47] <ackpacket> grub is...?
[05:47] <ackpacket> It has to do with booting, i know that much
[05:47] <wilee-nilee> the bootloader
[05:47] <Dr_Willis> Grub needs to go on the MBR of the hard driv you boot
[05:47] <ackpacket> Why does linux need a loader like grub?  Do all OS's use a setup like that?
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> if you install to the usb thats on sdc , you need to be sure grub is going onto sdc, NOT sdc1, not sda, not sdb ;)
[05:48] <ackpacket> maybe I shouldn't be bothering this chan with basic questions though
[05:48] <wilee-nilee> ackpacket, You could manual boot it.
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> ackpacket:  windows has its own bootloader its called  'ntldr' dos has its own called. err.. mssys.dos or somting
[05:48] <wilee-nilee> bcd from vista on
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> live cds normally use isolinux as their bootloader
[05:49] <Dr_Willis> live usbs normally use syslinux
[05:49] <Dr_Willis> RaspberryPi - does somthing totally different. ;) but thats because the Pi is Special ;P
[05:50] <ackpacket> Which of these two options would the two of you use for applying a full install to the usb:  I could run the "live-cd" from usbA, and select full install and apply it to usbB, OR I could download the installer that you can run on a windows machine, and select the USB to install to
[05:50] <Dr_Willis> ackpacket:  the installe ryou run on windows. is wubi..  AVOIDE wubi
[05:50] <Dr_Willis> thats not a normal full install at all.
[05:50] <ackpacket> I love the pi, it's saved me so much effort when developing specific devices.  Can you imagine trying to recode TCP/IP in chips like the avr?
[05:51] <Dr_Willis> boot live usbA -> install to bigger usb B
[05:51] <ackpacket> is this something I can do on a virtual pc without any problems?
[05:52] <Dr_Willis> virtual pc - installing to a real plysical flash drive?
[05:52] <ackpacket> setup virtual pc to boot from ubuntu iso, select full install, apply to real physical flash drive
[05:52] <Dr_Willis> no idea how it would handle the bootloader with that setup. it may get confused
[05:53] <Dr_Willis> if using Vbox. the #vbox guys may know of any issues

[06:27] <aeon-ltd> yeah........
[06:28] <Guest71445> oh hahhaaaa ok
[06:28] <Dr_Willis> easiest way to get stubborn cards going is to either. run a wire :) untill you get the  addational-drivers tool to install the drivers needed.. or buy a nice wifi dongle that works out of the box. and use it to get the addational-drivers ;)
[06:28] <agthoma> So I just loaded Ubuntu 13.04 with Gnome....but I have no sound.  Multiple message boards have been unable to solve my problem.  Anyone know how to fix it?
[06:28] <johnlangat> how do i correct this  Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
=== c_smith is now known as c_smith_away
[06:29] <johnlangat> Am new in ubuntu
[06:29] <Dr_Willis> johnlangat:  only ONE app that is manageing the packages is allowed to run at a time
[06:29] <aeon-ltd> agthoma: fresh install?
[06:29] <Dr_Willis> johnlangat:  so close any other apt tools.
[06:29] <agthoma> yes
[06:29] <Dr_Willis> !fixapt
[06:29] <ubottu> If an APT front-end crashed and your database is locked, try this in a !terminal: « sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a »
[06:29] <aeon-ltd> agthoma: do you have a dedicated sound card? like a pci one?
[06:30] <agthoma> I'm on a 2008 macbook air....so it's some little ghetto card.
[06:30] <aeon-ltd> ok
[06:30] <aeon-ltd> agthoma: check basic stuff like alsamixer, your source, headphone jack occupied etc
[06:31] <agthoma> already checked the alsa mixer and tried a force reload on it per a message board.  I'm not sure about the headphone jack occupied though
[06:32] <aeon-ltd> agthoma: is your jack physically occupied?
[06:32] <agthoma> Oh....no
[06:32] <agthoma> LOL
[06:32] <johnlangat> how do i lock administration directory ubuntu 12.04
[06:33] <agthoma> I thought that was some kind of fantsy linux lingo. :)
[06:33] <Ben64> johnlangat: what are you really trying to accomplish
[06:34] <johnlangat> am trying to run sudo apt-get update
[06:34] <johnlangat> by i i get message: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[06:34] <Ben64> ok, well close synaptic or update manager or ubuntu software center or whatever is using it
[06:35] <johnlangat> Ben64:All are closed
[06:36] <Dr_Willis> !fixapt | johnlangat
[06:36] <ubottu> johnlangat: If an APT front-end crashed and your database is locked, try this in a !terminal: « sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a »
[06:36] <kostkon> johnlangat, something is still running, give:  ps -A | grep apt
[06:36] <Dr_Willis> you could log out/back in and see if it closes out the stuff.. or try that command the bot mentions above.
[06:37] <Dr_Willis> its possible the update manager is doing somting in the background also
[06:37] <Ben64> or "sudo fuser -v /var/lib/dpkg/lock" will show you what is using it
[06:38] <ry_> willing to paypal 20 bucks to whoever can help me solve this wifi driver issue
[06:38] <agthoma> Willing to help....or actually able to solve? :)
[06:39] <Ben64> ry_: use $8 of that $20 to get a better supported wireless usb?

[06:53] <kimda> Hi. I am noticing a weird networking problem with a ubuntu guest (kvm). I can ping certain addresses but with another I will not get any reply back. On the host I see with tcpdump requests but no replies. Also when i do a apt-cache search it takes a couple of seconds to receive results. Any ideas what could be causing this?
[06:55] <LinuxGold> kimda:  cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6
[06:55] <LinuxGold> see if it is 0 or 1
[06:57] <ShapeShifter499> aeon-ltd, reisio thank you

[06:59] <gagan> hello there..?
[06:59] <gagan> i have some proplem in ubuntu 13.04
[07:00] <reisio> gagan: hi
[07:01] <kimda> LinuxGold, I have changed the settings with sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 but its the same as before
[07:01] <LinuxGold> even after rebooted?
[07:01] <gagan> reisio: i have some problem in   appearence
[07:02] <gagan> theme is not changing
[07:02] <kimda> no i haven't rebooted it. but i think if you change it like that its immediate
[07:02] <gagan> showing only one option  high contrest
[07:02] <LinuxGold> because the output is still 0
[07:02] <LinuxGold> reboot should change to 1 --
[07:03] <kimda> no its 1 now
[07:03] <LinuxGold> cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6 is now 1 right?
[07:05] <kimda> yes
[07:05] <LinuxGold> ok, is kvm network adapter set to bridged?
[07:05] <kimda> yes
[07:05] <LinuxGold> accepts all right?
[07:05] <kimda> yes i can ssh to it..ping it from the outside and from host
[07:06] <kimda> only certain addresses are not pingable
[07:06] <raven> hi
[07:06] <kimda> from within the guest
[07:06] <LinuxGold> ok, is apt still having problem?
[07:06] <kimda> from the host i can ping these addresses
[07:06] <kimda> yes
[07:06] <LinuxGold> interesting...
[07:06] <Andre_designer> how can i get volumecontrol in smaller steps by keyboard??
[07:06] <LinuxGold> guest ip on the same subnet as outside?
[07:07] <kimda> yes
[07:07] <LinuxGold> hmm.. last try -- restart the networking to force guest to get dynamic IP address from dhcp?
[07:08] <raven> xubuntu 12.04.3 lts: build of http://sourceforge.net/projects/electricowl/files/latest/download results in that: http://pastebin.com/KFXiqpJn - all headers installed - whats the problem?
[07:08] <kimda> unfortunately i cannot do this. the address is a public ip and needs to be accessible from outside.
[07:08] <LinuxGold> ah....
[07:08] <Andre_designer> how can i get volumecontrol in smaller steps by keyboard??
[07:08] <kimda> what i was wondering about is that maybe the mac address could be the problem
[07:09] <LinuxGold> mac address shouldn't be a problem, I think?
[07:09] <LinuxGold> I'm suspecting DNS
[07:09] <kimda> well...i've read somewhere that the mac address on a guest should be higher (or lower) than the host
[07:10] <kimda> the host gets resolved
[07:10] <LinuxGold> ifconfig, on both host and guest -- make sure they do not match
[07:10] <LinuxGold> on the mac address listed
[07:10] <Benkinooby> hi, when i am in a console (non-X) $TERM is 'linux' - is ther a way to get that terminal for GUI too?
[07:10] <kutzu> where can i get a list of supported bluetooth dongles for ubuntu?
[07:11] <cfhowlett> !hardware|kutzu,
[07:11] <ubottu> kutzu,: For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport - To help debugging and improving hardware detection, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingHardwareDetection
[07:11] <kimda> they are different
[07:11] <LinuxGold> k, then mac address should not be a problem.
[07:11] <kimda> whats weird is that if i do tcpdump -v icmp on the host
[07:12] <kutzu> i dont see usb dongle on that page
[07:13] <kimda> start a ping say to google.com from the guest that i see replies. When i  do belnet.be I see only requests and no replies
[07:13] <kutzu> can anyone recommend one that is supported by ubuntu?
[07:13] <Aceface> whats up shitheads

[07:14] <Andre_designer> anyone??
[07:14] <LinuxGold> kimda: host can see belnet.be?
[07:14] <LinuxGold> but not guest?
[07:14] <kimda> yes it resolved
[07:14] <kimda> resolves to ip
[07:14] <LinuxGold> looks like DNS problem for guest
[07:15] <LinuxGold> DNS is something that I am not really good with.
[07:15] <LinuxGold> check /etc/resolv.conf?
[07:15] <LinuxGold> hold
[07:15] <kimda> but it  resolves to ip so how can this be a dns problem
[07:15] <LinuxGold> like I said before, I'm not really good with DNS
[07:16] <kimda> if i ping the same ipaddress i still am not getting any replies
[07:16] <LinuxGold> anyone know kimda's problem?

[07:35] <mercury00> hi all. anyone know the best way to archive a 100gb file.
[07:35] <mercury00> cpio has a limit, either 4 or 8 gb. tar as well, though I don't know the limit.
[07:35] <err_> when selecting a mirror in software sources, is it best to choose ftp or http for downloading? Why?
[07:36] <iceroot> err_: does not matter on your site
[07:36] <mercury00> err_: yeah, the data kind of comes to you the same, genearlly, on your side of things,
[07:37] <raven> xubuntu 12.04.3 lts: build of http://sourceforge.net/projects/electricowl/files/latest/download results in that: http://pastebin.com/KFXiqpJn - all headers installed - whats the problem?
[07:37] <err_> why doesn't it matter, iceroot? I heard that http was better for reconnecting, if the connection keeps dropping out. That is a surprise to me, as ftp is specifically designed for file transfer...
[07:37] <mercury00> err_: if you have both options. If you happen to be using a browser that doesn't understand ftp, use http, if you happen to only have an ftp client available, well.
[07:38] <iceroot> err_: and you are only doing file-transfer in this case
[07:38] <mercury00> err_: yes, well they are different software on the servers end. however, for most uses today, and on modern systems... it's not usually a big thing...
[07:39] <err_> mercury00, iceroot, it is when setting up the ubuntu "software and updates" application, not when browsing a site with firefox...
[07:39] <err_> it is for when using apt-get update...
[07:39] <iceroot> err_: i know
[07:39] <iceroot> err_: and you are only doing file-transfer for that usecase
[07:40] <mercury00> err_: I've just always used http; though I run a few hunderd desktops so use my own local repo and only serve from apache, so no other choice
[07:41] <err_> thanks, mercury00, thanks iceroot!
[07:43] <mercury00> err_: I'm not sure what apt uses for connecting via ftp, that is, what system library it calls specifically, though I assume it connects with an anonymous user and no password, and PASV. without being able to dig into the library and see what the implementation difference is, I'd assume the only other difference is the port.
[07:43] <mercury00> err_: ftp ought to default to 21, while http is going to use 80. if either of those ports are blocked, spammed, or otherwise troublesome, if might make a difference
[07:44] <err_> why does ubuntu not ship with aptitude? the default is apt-get. aptitude has advantages...
[07:44] <somsip> !aptitude | err_
[07:44] <ubottu> err_: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and 12.04) as aptitude cannot  handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[07:45] <mercury00> err_: that, I do not know. I always install it just so I can do 'aptitude search ....'
[07:45] <err_> thanks, somsip - i didn't know that...
[07:45] <mercury00> ah, thanks ubottu, that was useful
[07:45] <somsip> err_: np
[07:46] <sliddjur> Anyone here having trouble using citrix reciever on ubuntu 13, 64bit?
[07:46] <sliddjur> My PC hangs atleast once a day
[07:46] <mercury00> so I heard pax can handle very large files; is there any other tar-like utility that can do so?
[07:46] <mercury00> I frequently need to 'tar' several 100gb files into a single file for long term storage. and tar/cpio don't handle them,
[07:47] <mercury00> 'field width not sufficient' and such; curious if anybody on the ubuntu channels might know a good alternative
[07:49] <iceroot> if i want to share my internet connection (create my own AP when already connected with cable) the new wifi network i want to create is only offering WEP, is that a bug in network-manager? or does my wifi card has to support WPA for hosting own networks?

[08:17] <Bagheera> evening on the west coast?
[08:18] <SwashBuckla> hmm, my iPod shuffle (latest generation) has been wiped by Rhythmbox when I tried to sync with the library. Now I get the voice "Please use iTunes to restore this iPod" when I listen to my iPod shuffle. How do I fix this?
[08:18] <Bagheera> SwashBuckla, there's a program to sync itunes correctly
[08:19] <SwashBuckla> Bagheera: OK, what is that program?
[08:19] <Bagheera> GTKPod
[08:19] <SwashBuckla> Bagheera: and if I use that, will that be able to restore my iPod so that I can listen to music again?
[08:19] <Bagheera> you should be able to
[08:19] <SwashBuckla> (cool IRC name by the way)
[08:20] <Bagheera> itunes uses a table to refer to the tracks on it, and gtkpod can update the table
[08:20] <SwashBuckla> ok
[08:20] <Bagheera> SwashBuckla: the name is cause my son looked like Mowgli when he was born
[08:21] <SwashBuckla> :3
[08:21] <SwashBuckla> awesome
[08:22] <SwashBuckla> Bagheera: do you look like a panther?

[08:36] <edward_> hi
[08:36] <Hanumaan> how to scroll through desktops on both monitors as of now only one monitor is getting scorolled I am using gnome dekstop ?
[08:38] <rhumbot> hi all, i have 2 versions of ubuntu on my laptop. version 12.10 and 13.04. 12.10 has texlive-full package installed
[08:39] <rhumbot> can i copy this package to 13.04 without reinstalling?
[08:39] <cfhowlett> rhumbot, not advisable to mix distros in that manner ...
[08:40] <rhumbot> actually, all i need to get is a couple of files from the package, not the installation itself
[08:40] <rhumbot> how can i locate the package ? :/

[08:46] <pseudonymous> So I just came back into my room today to find both my machines having gone through a powercycle for some reason (could be thermal, could be someone tripping a wire, I don't know) -- one machine booted up nicely (this one) - the other will not boot anymore. All normal kernels hang with a black screen, the recovery kernel entry hangs after "loading initial ramdisk"
[08:47] <ObrienDave> pseudonymous... any external USB drives connected?
[08:47] <gRAVIty2> Here is the problem: The application Compiz has closed unexpectedly
[08:48] <gRAVIty2> I have taken screen shots of the error details and you can them here. They are in continuation 1) http://imagebin.org/270644 2)http://imagebin.org/270645 3)http://imagebin.org/270644

[08:49] <pseudonymous> ObrienDave: nope. I've got an onboard nic, an extra 10GB nic w. 2 slots, 1 mouse, 1 keyboard and a monitor via DVI, that's it
[08:50] <ObrienDave> umm, that happens to me if I forget to unplug my USB to SATA adapter
[08:51] <pseudonymous> ObrienDava: Yes, I'm sort of thinking it's got to do with it being unable to find the device to boot off of, but it's a regular ubuntu install on a new haswell rig so it's all Grub2 and UEFI mess :( I haven't a clue where to begin debugging
[08:51] <ObrienDave> pseudonymous... any live ISO you can try booting and repairing with?
[08:52] <ObrienDave> oh lordy, UFEI, not my cup of tea
[08:53] <teddy___> Hello!

[08:56] <teddy___> I have a problem with installing wxpython on ubuntu: i want to use wxpython with python2.7 (installed with altinstall to leave the default python installation untouched). How can i let python2.7 recognize the wxpython install from synaptic?
[08:56] <ObrienDave> gRAVIty2... no biggie, thanks

[09:01] <gRAVIty2> ObrienDave: any thoughts on the problem?
[09:01] <pseudonymous> ObrienDave: Just finished bothering someone for a USB pen :) I'll have to install ubuntu onto it somehow, but I imagine there's a guide for that, I'll see how that goes
[09:02] <ObrienDave> pseudonymous... use good comp to DL ISO and UNetBootin to install on USB stick
[09:02] <Kurza> hello, I run ubuntu 10.04 server and I have libssl0.9.8(k) installed as a package that a few other packages depends on. However, to install another package that I want installed I need libssl0.9.8(m) or above. Does anyone know how can I do that small upgrade (all the other packages that depends on libssl0.9.8 can use higher version of it)

[09:07] <ObrienDave> nightwalkerkg... how soon after? screensaver maybe?
[09:08] <[Gentoo]> nightwalkerkg: can you reach a console by ctrl alt and f3
[09:08] <nightwalkerkg> ObrienDave: It's on boot,just after it the Ubuntu logo shows.
[09:08] <nightwalkerkg> [Gentoo]: Yes i can.

[09:09] <foo357> Hello, I'm having a problem with a full boot sector. apt-get can't do anything about it, if I try to remove old 'linux images' it fails (due to lack of space in /boot)
[09:11] <nightwalkerkg> [Gentoo]: Any ideas ?
[09:12] <UserError> is add-apt-repository main a valid arg, and can there be more than one, ie add-apt-repository main universe restricted multiverse
[09:13] <[Gentoo]> nightwalkerkg: sorry bit busy, was this after a driver update or something
[09:13] <nightwalkerkg> Nope,i turned my pc off yesterday and when i tried it now it won't boot.
[09:13] <nightwalkerkg> I have a dual boot with windows 7.
[09:14] <[Gentoo]> nightwalkerkg: not sure tbh. how long have you left it on the blank screen for?
[09:14] <nightwalkerkg> About 5 minutes.
[09:14] <ObrienDave> nightwalkerkg... will windows boot?
[09:14] <nightwalkerkg> Yes it will.
[09:14] <nightwalkerkg> I am on windows now.
[09:15] <nightwalkerkg> [Gentoo]: It's not really a blank screen,the monitor turns off.
[09:15] <[Gentoo]> nightwalkerkg: this might sound stupid, but try draining the power completely, turn off the pc and unplug it, press the power button few times then turn it back on
[09:15] <nightwalkerkg> Actualy it's not stupid. xD
[09:15] <nightwalkerkg> Let me try.

[09:22] <nightwalkerkg> [Gentoo]: Lol,i pressed the power button on the monitor and i got a message that there is no input source coming from my pc (something like that) and it asked me to select the right source.
[09:22] <[Gentoo]> nightwalkerkg: and it worked?
[09:22] <nightwalkerkg> Nope. :D
[09:22] <[Gentoo]> did you drain the power on the pc?
[09:23] <nightwalkerkg> My monitor is connected to my pc via HDMI cable,so ubuntu doesn't recognize the cable or there is something really wrong with the drivers.
[09:23] <nightwalkerkg> [Gentoo]: Yes i did.
[09:23] <[Gentoo]> its not the cable if windows works
[09:23] <[Gentoo]> no idea, you could reinstall the drivers / check for logs from the console
[09:23] <[Gentoo]> do you get any login sound or anything when the monitors off?
[09:24] <nightwalkerkg> Let me try to connect it via vga.
[09:24] <[Gentoo]> good idea
[09:24] <nightwalkerkg> Not sure,my speakers are off. xD
[09:24] <ObrienDave> nightwalkerkg... sounds like a grub problem, maybe
[09:24] <[Gentoo]> ObrienDave: no he can get to a console
[09:24] <ObrienDave> ok, *lurking*
[09:25] <ihre> Im trying to install vmware-workstation, but the installer segfaults. How can I identify the cause? I tried gdb, but the file format isnt recognized (vmware-workstation-full-9.0.1-894247.x86_64.bundle": not in executable format: File format not recognized).

[09:33] <[Gentoo]> you can create a mbr partition table with fdisk or gpt with gdisk
[09:34] <[Gentoo]> just run sudo fdisk /dev/sdc   press n then press enter all the way to the end
[09:34] <[Gentoo]> then w
[09:34] <dheeraj_> Ohkk let me try
[09:35] <nightwalkerkg> [Gentoo]: Nope,it's the same with VGA. No signal comming from the pc. Like the GPU decides to turn off.
[09:35] <[Gentoo]> that will create 1 partition with a mbr partition table, then you can run mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1

[09:39] <Wiz_KeeD> what is the best solution?
[09:39] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: plain xchat if you had to choose
[09:39] <Wiz_KeeD> What would be the difference [Gentoo] ?
[09:40] <DJones> Wiz_KeeD: From memory, xchat-gnome is a simplified version of xchat
[09:40] <[Gentoo]> its the normal version, but if hexchat is in the repos use that
[09:40] <[Gentoo]> as its updated and maintained

[09:41] <Wiz_KeeD> I'm not installing one package without asking you guys beforehand
[09:41] <Wiz_KeeD> not after what happened last time
[09:42] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: the gnome one prob has some desktop integration stuff
[09:42] <[Gentoo]> you're not gona break anything installing either of them
[09:42] <Wiz_KeeD> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XChat-GNOME - looks ugly too
[09:42] <DJones> Wiz_KeeD: Simplified as in it doesn't do everything that xchat does, I don't think it has a user list, things like that
[09:42] <Wiz_KeeD> And I always do a sudo apt-get update before, right?
[09:42] <ObrienDave> pseudonymous... you running Win8?
[09:42] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: use "xchat" if you really want that client
[09:42] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: yes
[09:42] <Wiz_KeeD> Thank you [Gentoo] and DJones will install that now that i'm sure
[09:43] <Wiz_KeeD> ok ran sudo apt-get update, now just sudo apt-get install xchat?
[09:43] <[Gentoo]> yes
[09:43] <Wiz_KeeD> nothing else? (It's a fresh fresh install, 2 minutes ago)
[09:43] <lessless> or is it possible to move launch panel to the right?
[09:43] <[Gentoo]> nope

[09:46] <ObrienDave> have you checked BIOS (UEFI) settings lately?
[09:46] <Wiz_KeeD> Now who can help me with one of the most difficult task ahead? Installing the proper drivers :-s
[09:46] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: now you can mess around with all the settings :)
[09:46] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: for what
[09:46] <[Gentoo]> graphics? most drivers are in the kernel
[09:46] <Wiz_KeeD> Dell Inspiron...some version idk which
[09:46] <[Gentoo]> for things like sound etc
[09:47] <pseudonymous> ObrienDave: nope, the downed PC is Linux-only, both of them are :)
[09:47] <ObrienDave> pseudonymous... have you checked BIOS (UEFI) settings lately?
[09:47] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: well what doesnt work?
[09:47] <Wiz_KeeD> graphics mostly, last time I had ubuntu 12.04 if i upped/downed the brightness fast the monitor would just color up ugly and freeze
[09:47] <Wiz_KeeD> I'm afraid to do that now...
[09:47] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: if its integrated graphics then you're likely using them now
[09:47] <ObrienDave> pseudonymous... but it still has bios settings
[09:47] <Wiz_KeeD> I don't think so [Gentoo] some ATI which is not integrated
[09:47] <Wiz_KeeD> I can try
[09:48] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: atis default kernel driver is the most stable
[09:48] <Wiz_KeeD> HMM...now it works [Gentoo] !
[09:48] <ObrienDave> pseudonymous... how old is it? more than 5 years?
[09:48] <pseudonymous> ObrienDave: it does indeed, or rather some graphical UEFI boot manager thing. It still registers the boot partition as my samsung ssd and grub does indeed load all the time, it's only at the handoff point (loading initial ramdisk) that things freeze up
[09:48] <Wiz_KeeD> really? ok then I won't touch them
[09:48] <[Gentoo]> Wiz_KeeD: nah i wouldnt
[09:48] <Wiz_KeeD> I do get an error about wireless card when the system is booting up
[09:48] <Wiz_KeeD> Could not locate firmware or something like that
[09:49] <[Gentoo]> are you using the wireless now?
[09:49] <pseudonymous> Wiz_KeeD: doesn't Ubuntu give you a popup ? THere's usually a notice in the top right through which you can elect to install proprietary drivers, ubuntu would handle the rest for you
[09:50] <[Gentoo]> pseudonymous: with ATI cards unless you have a need for more 3d accel, the default drivers are quicker and more stable
[09:51] <Hanumaan> how to move scroll through desktops in both the monitors ?
[09:51] <Wiz_KeeD> Guess what [Gentoo], it crashed
[09:51] <[Gentoo]> what did
[09:51] <Wiz_KeeD> I would make MILIONS for the ubuntu as a bug tester I swear to God
[09:52] <[Gentoo]> lol
[09:52] <Wiz_KeeD> I upped and downed the brightness and volume from the keyboard
[09:52] <Wiz_KeeD> and It blacked out while repeating a sound
[09:52] <[Gentoo]> no idea about that issue
[09:52] <Wiz_KeeD> And I still get the wireless card error on bood
[09:52] <Wiz_KeeD> boot
[09:52] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah...no one does and ever will, that's just my luck
[09:52] <[Gentoo]> you might need some prop driver for it
[09:52] <[Gentoo]> i dont know
[09:53] <[Gentoo]> but i got to go out do school runs good luck
[09:53] <ObrienDave> pseudonymous... here's the UEFI settings link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[09:53] <pseudonymous> Gentoo: oh I'm not surprised :) But I never use ATI. I have nvidia and as of late I'm moving to intel seeing as they're picking up speed and the drivers are great (stability-wise)

[09:54] <ObrienDave> oh geez. glwt
[09:56] <ObrienDave> brb
[09:56] <pseudonymous> ObrienDave: yea :/ I know this is the wrong forum to say this, but there's a reason I run Arch Linux otherwise, I know it's never more complex than what I set up to begin with. Straight partitions, MBR and Syslinux is wee bit easier than GPT,GRUB2,LVM2 :/

[10:05] <Wiz_KeeD> Installing skype for ubuntu is best of from repository or from skype main site?
[10:06] <cfhowlett> Wiz_KeeD, from repos is best ...

[10:07] <Wiz_KeeD> Record on skype? ah
[10:07] <Wiz_KeeD> I'll read that DJones, thank you!!
[10:08] <cfhowlett> DJones, apt-cache policy skype shows it's in the partner packages on 12.04
[10:08] <Wiz_KeeD> Is this really ok guys? sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
[10:08] <Wiz_KeeD> Some people say: "you don't want to install a packages that was not compiled for your platform. Either get a 64bit version or compile it yourself. "
[10:08] <Wiz_KeeD> What do you think DJones ?
[10:10] <Wiz_KeeD> There's a part of my answer "It is highly recommended to use the package provided in the Canonical partner repository, not the one distributed from the skype website, as the skype website currently points users to the wrong package for 64-bit systems of Ubuntu 11.10 and above.
[10:10] <zhangxun> hello !everybody

[10:10] <DJones> Wiz_KeeD: If you're on a 64 bit machine, I think the installer for Skype is aimed at 32 bit machines, so I think you;'d have to do that, I don't use skype so I can't say how well it works, hopefully somebody else here can help though
[10:11] <Wiz_KeeD> I do use 64

[10:43] <siberiannerd> should i write a bug report if expert install from 12.04.3 cd1 was finished without warnings and after reboot i end up with grub's "error: file not found." ?
[10:48] <ikonia> siberiannerd: no
[10:48] <siberiannerd> ikonia, what should i do?
[10:48] <ikonia> fix the problem
[10:48] <ikonia> and not cross-post the same question in mulitple ubuntu channels
[10:48] <siberiannerd> ikonia, i tried twice with alternate and server, just asked for server
=== Mayzie is now known as Mayzie`
[10:49] <ikonia> siberiannerd: trying twice is not fixing the problem
[10:49] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, did you actually install grub?  where?  how do we reproduce the problem?  especially since most people haven't had your experience;
[10:49] <ikonia> it's not even understanding the problem
[10:49] <ikonia> siberiannerd: the first qestion I'd ask, is did you use a DVD, or a USB,
[10:51] <siberiannerd> ikonia, hdd
[10:51] <siberiannerd> cfhowlett, i can describe the steps to reproduce if you want me to
[10:51] <siberiannerd> if i should to deal with it properly
[10:52] <ikonia> siberiannerd: hdd ?
[10:52] <ikonia> you used a hard disk to install from ?
[10:52] <siberiannerd> ikonia, hard disk drive
[10:52] <siberiannerd> yeah, why not?
[10:52] <ikonia> siberiannerd: how did you install from hard disk ?
[10:53] <siberiannerd> as it described by official manpages for debian installer and anywhere
[10:53] <siberiannerd> without 3rd party tools to put an image to drive
[10:53] <ikonia> if you can't be bothered answering questions - we can't help
[10:53] <siberiannerd> ok, ikonia, dd if=iso of=hdd
[10:53] <siberiannerd> and here we go
[10:53] <ikonia> siberiannerd: that don't install it
[10:53] <ikonia> siberiannerd: so please don't try to be clever when YOU are the one asking for help
[10:54] <siberiannerd> ikonia, well you're terribly wrong
[10:54] <ikonia> oh, really, dd'ing an install image to a harddisk = an install ?
[10:54] <siberiannerd> you never read about debian installation procedure from hdd?
[10:54] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, umm, no that is NOT an installation procedure for ubuntu.
[10:54] <siberiannerd> sorry to hear that
[10:54] <ikonia> siberiannerd: I'm asking what YOU did
[10:54] <siberiannerd> i jsut said what i did
[10:54] <siberiannerd> i'm not lying
[10:54] <ikonia> siberiannerd: that is not an install
[10:54] <ikonia> siberiannerd: that is just putting an install iso onto a hard disk
[10:55] <siberiannerd> i've put the installation media iso like that
[10:55] <siberiannerd> after what i specified nodmraid nomodset expertinstall
[10:55] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, suggest you try this: make a boot ISO on usb.  Boot from that ISO and choose install.
[10:56] <siberiannerd> ikonia, should i continue describing the steps over stages?
[10:56] <ObrienDave> siberiannerd... an ISO has to be burned to a DVD or CD or installed onto a USB stick
[10:56] <siberiannerd> no it shouldn't
[10:56] <ikonia> siberiannerd: just lost total interest thanks to you trying to be smart with your answers, see if someone else wants to help you
[10:56] <siberiannerd> works flawless
[10:56] <ObrienDave> ok, if you say so
[10:56] <siberiannerd> ikonia, i didn't try to you was just pointing that i was doing something wrong
[10:57] <siberiannerd> come on guys i'm not trying to act clever or anything like that
[10:57] <siberiannerd> i came with a problem i can't troubleshoot properly
[10:57] <ikonia> it doesn't come across like that
[10:57] <ikonia> as dd'ing the install image to the hard disk is NOT an install
[10:57] <ikonia> it's dd'ing the install image to a hard disk - nothing more
[10:57] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, listen up.  copying to the HDD is NOT installing.  what you did is NOT an installation.
[10:57] <siberiannerd> well let me read some manpages or howtos so i could behave more polite or being more informative
[10:58] <siberiannerd> oh ok
[10:58] <bazhang> !attitude | siberiannerd
[10:58] <ubottu> siberiannerd: The people here are volunteers, your attitude should reflect that. Answers are not always available. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines
[10:58] <siberiannerd> uhm i know that
[10:58] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, try this:    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
[10:59] <siberiannerd> so i launched the setup from alternate image that was written to hdd via dd, completed the procedure of installation on the second hdd having /boot and mbr on the 3rd one
[10:59] <siberiannerd> which resulted the above
[10:59] <kuribas> How do I set environment variable for X apps?
[11:00] <siberiannerd> d-i never prompted warnings or anything else
[11:00] <kuribas> My variables in .bashrc aren't read.
[11:01] <siberiannerd> cfhowlett, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromHardDriveWithFloppies
[11:01] <siberiannerd> but without any floppies
[11:01] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, you did note that this method is for UNSUPPORTED version of ubuntu?  That means ... unsupported here as well.
[11:02] <siberiannerd> somewhat no
[11:03] <ObrienDave> siberiannerd... and it is also written for an 8 year old system?
[11:03] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, yeah that big pink banner across the top of the page.
[11:03] <siberiannerd> ObrienDave, it has even 8 years old bugs in it so i thought it would be fine
[11:03] <geirha> kuribas: Set environment variables in .profile. They do not belong in .bashrc
[11:04] <ObrienDave> omg *face palm*
[11:04] <kuribas> geirha: Ok, I'll try that.
[11:04] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, you're installing 12.04 using an outdated, end of life methodology?  OOOOOOkay then.
[11:04] <geirha> kuribas: You may also set them in .pam_environment, which is read by the pam_env module when you log in, though note that .pam_environment is not a shell script, so shell syntax won't work in there.
[11:04] <siberiannerd> ObrienDave, so there is not proper way to use hdd as installation media for ubuntu, is that correct?
[11:04] <ObrienDave> siberiannerd... have fun with that. *lurking*
[11:04] <siberiannerd> no, seriously
[11:05] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, back up.  Can your box boot from USB?
[11:05] <siberiannerd> nope
[11:05] <pseudonymous> Err yes it can
[11:05] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, ok.  what are the machine specs. it matters.
[11:05] <siberiannerd> no
[11:06] <siberiannerd> ok, it's mini-itx zotac mb without usb controlled on it
[11:06] <siberiannerd> should i get deeper into details?
[11:06] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, nope.
[11:06] <siberiannerd> r*
[11:06] <ObrienDave> siberiannerd... is there a DVD burner?
[11:06] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, I would suggest you consider using lubuntu or xubuntu though.  Both are optimized for older and lower spec machines.
[11:07] <siberiannerd> no, cd-rom is not integrated in motherboard unfortunately
[11:07] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, from that page I sent you:   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManager
[11:07] <siberiannerd> cfhowlett, can i read about supported method of installing xubuntu from hdd media?
[11:07] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, same method as in the tutorial, just different OS.
[11:08] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, actually see the section: Installation without a CD"
[11:09] <siberiannerd> cfhowlett, yeah but the only option in there is unsupported
[11:09] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, it's also possible you could do a network installation.  See server and network installations in that tutorial
[11:09] <siberiannerd> as you pointed me to that pink banner
[11:10] <siberiannerd> pxe is buggy in there
[11:10] <cfhowlett> siberiannerd, dern.  I was literally tying PXE for your next optoin.
[11:10] <cfhowlett> *option*
[11:10] <siberiannerd> i wouldn't come if it was an option

[11:13] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... where did you get a 64bit version???
[11:13] <kizzx2> apt-get install dsc12
[11:13] <Wiz_KeeD> of ubuntu ObrienDave ?
[11:13] <kizzx2> but it says The following packages have unmet dependencies:

[11:14] <ObrienDave> no, Skype
[11:14] <Wiz_KeeD> ikonia, that link suggest you should include 32 bit applications in your repository, something that a lot of people do not recommend
[11:14] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... I meant 13.04 64bit?
[11:14] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: so what's the problem then ?
[11:14] <Wiz_KeeD> 12.04 ObrienDave
[11:15] <ObrienDave> ok use the link
[11:15] <Wiz_KeeD> ikonia, because from what I know installing 32-bit applications on 64 is not that good...also if i'm going to install the 32 bit one, why not use the one from skype.com?
[11:15] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... this will get you the latest 32bit file. http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-linux-beta-ubuntu-64
[11:15] <siberiannerd> but uhm i don't have any bootable options but hdd unfortunately
[11:15] <Wiz_KeeD> ObrienDave, that's what the link suggests
[11:15] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: it is the one from skype.com
[11:15] <Wiz_KeeD> sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
[11:15] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: where is the native 64bit skype client ?
[11:15] <Lemino> I'll come back at another time!
[11:15] <Wiz_KeeD> I have no idea ikonia
[11:15] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: right, it doesn't exist
[11:16] <ObrienDave> ikonia... miscommunication on the 64bit Skype
[11:16] <ikonia> ObrienDave: do share
[11:16] <ObrienDave> there isn't one, like you said ;))
[11:17] <Wiz_KeeD> So it would be safe to add the 32 bit architecture then?
[11:17] <ikonia> ObrienDave: so how is that  miscommunication ?
[11:17] <Wiz_KeeD> You guys did that?
[11:17] <siberiannerd> ok, ubuntu can't be installed from hdd i got it
[11:17] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: I don't like adding the 32bit arch to the repos, no
[11:17] <ObrienDave> oh lordy, nevermind
[11:17] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: however, that is the current documented process
[11:18] <Wiz_KeeD> hmmm
[11:19] <Wiz_KeeD> how the hell can I get skype on my computer without adding the 32bit arch to the repos and still be able to upgrade it and all that...
[11:19] <siberiannerd> should i write a feature request so the installation from hdd media could get some attention and support?
[11:19] <ikonia> siberiannerd: nah
[11:19] <siberiannerd> ikonia, why not?
[11:19] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... install ia32libs then Skype
[11:19] <jrib> Wiz_KeeD: why don't you want to add 32bit multiarch capability?
[11:19] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: i shouldn't stop you upgrading
[11:20] <Wiz_KeeD> jrib, because when searching for other software I wouldn't want to install 32bit designed packages that might not be optimized for 64
[11:20] <jrib> Wiz_KeeD: that wouldn't happen unless you ask for it explicitly
[11:20] <Wiz_KeeD> ObrienDave, then all 32bit applications will be available for download, something I wouldn't neccesairly want
[11:20] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: it doesn't work like that
[11:21] <Wiz_KeeD> I'm sorry, I'm new to this, it may very well be possible, I just read about it
[11:21] <Wiz_KeeD> Ready to be educated though :D
[11:21] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... no, that just adds 32bit support to 12.04
[11:22] <Wiz_KeeD> ikonia still doesn't do it for a reason :)
[11:23] <BluesKaj> 'Morning all
[11:24] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... ia32libs just adds 32bit support to 12.04. necessary for some programs like most 3rd party SecondLife clients
[11:27] <Wiz_KeeD> ObrienDave, someone on the ubuntu forum says for example "you don't want to install a packages that was not compiled for your platform. Either get a 64bit version or compile it yourself. "
[11:27] <jrib> Wiz_KeeD: i've only seen skype provide 32bit packages.  Their 64bit package just depends on the 32bit real version.  Though I haven't check in the last few months
[11:28] <iceroot> Wiz_KeeD: use the 32bit version, there is no single need for skype in 64bit
[11:28] <iceroot> Wiz_KeeD: skype just needs to install some multiarch libs
[11:28] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... thats a PITA, just add ia32libs then install Skype. no biggie. it works
[11:29] <jrib> that shouldn't even be needed, just install skype after enabling multiarch
[11:29] <Wiz_KeeD> If more people with professional opinions suggest the same thing I think it's time to do it
[11:30] <Wiz_KeeD> ok sir!
[11:30] <iceroot> Wiz_KeeD: and to correct the part with "you dont want to install.." the real thing is "you dont want to install NSA/MS stuff on your free software product and you dont want to use such evil stuff anymore" that would be the correct part and not the architecutre thing :)
[11:31] <Wiz_KeeD> didn't get that fully tbh :-s
[11:31] <ObrienDave> iceroot... LOL
[11:31] <Wiz_KeeD> dpkg: error: unknown option --add-architecture

[11:37] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: no you didn't
[11:37] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: the standard repos do not conflict
[11:37] <Wiz_KeeD> ObrienDave, in the idea that I might mess up and need to revert
[11:38] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: the sooner you stop avoiding the advice of keep to the supported ubuntu repos, and don't try to compile software that conflicts with ubuntu software versions - you'll have no fatal problems
[11:38] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: other types of problems are normally straight forward to fix
[11:38] <Wiz_KeeD> That means I have to know when I install something else if it conflicts or not with ubuntu
[11:38] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... i do understand your concerns. there are enough good people here that if someone gives you the wrong info, they will be pummeled with a very large trout LMAO
[11:39] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: no, as if it's in the repo - it doesn't conflict.
[11:40] <Wiz_KeeD> hahahha, lol ObrienDave
[11:40] <Wiz_KeeD> ikonia, I understand
[11:40] <Wiz_KeeD> I'll drop the backup idea then
[11:40] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: nothing wrong with backups
[11:41] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: but a full system backup for every change, you'll just waste time/disk space
[11:41] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... backups are your friend, for sure
[11:41] <Wiz_KeeD> File backups are not important to me, I just code in python and save the code with dvcs like git or bzr
[11:41] <Wiz_KeeD> the rest is irrelevant
[11:42] <Guest87684> anyone can help me navigate to the "Computer" menu?
[11:42] <Daisyab__> i have 2 ubuntu accounts and i cant access one of them ever since i typed in a wrong path for installing xampp.  Can anyone help me recover my other account
[11:42] <ikonia> Daisyab__: xammp has nothing to do with your login
[11:42] <ObrienDave> Guest87684... what "computer" menu? on the desktop?
[11:43] <universal> how to find out if the currrent wireless driver on my system is the lastest one and if not then where to find latest or latest stable one ? hardware is - hp pavilion g6 series laptop with broadcom BCM4313 mini wifi card. current wireless driver is "wl" the default one available in ubuntu 13.04 installed from soft. sources > additional drivers tab. wireless driver package is "bcmwl-kernel-source" Veriosn - 6.20.155.1+bdcom-0ubuntu6
[11:43] <ikonia> universal: use the one ubuntu provides
[11:43] <Daisyab__> ikonia: i know that but after i typed in the wrong path for installing xampp that account doesn't open anymore
[11:43] <ikonia> Daisyab__: please define "doesn't open"
[11:43] <Daisyab__> i'm thinking that the wrong path was used and it had no where to go
[11:43] <universal> ikonia: ok...but the current driver 'wl' has some bugs
[11:44] <universal> ikonia: its freezes system now or then
[11:44] <Daisyab__> ikonia: after logging in with a password, my machine goes blank for a sec, then comes right back to the log in page
[11:45] <ikonia> Daisyab__: login as the other user then "su - $other_username"
[11:45] <ikonia> Daisyab__: see if that allows you to switch user withoout any errors/warnings
[11:46] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... did you d/l ia32libs yet?
[11:46] <Wiz_KeeD> It does not install ObrienDave because I started a backup with backintime program
[11:46] <Wiz_KeeD> now i'm trying to stop and remove it
[11:46] <Daisyab__> it does but i cant acces any of the files
[11:46] <Wiz_KeeD> But it moves very sluggish, adn even though I closed it in ps -aux | grep backintime
[11:46] <universal> !update
[11:46] <ubottu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[11:46] <Wiz_KeeD> I see a lot if instances running
[11:46] <ObrienDave> NO!!! dont stop the backup!
[11:46] <ikonia> Daisyab__: sounds like the permissions are wrong
[11:47] <Wiz_KeeD> and that download of lib is still in 0% in building depdenency tree
[11:47] <Wiz_KeeD> now what? :))
[11:47] <ikonia> Daisyab__: can you do "pwd" when you su - $username
[11:47] <Wiz_KeeD> Ubuntu is complex as hell man
[11:47] <gerep> Hi all. What's the Linux Mint channel? I'm worried about my notebook temperature. It's 79ºC (4 cores) and the fan is spinning loud and fast =/
[11:47] <ikonia> !mint | gerep
[11:47] <ubottu> gerep: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[11:47] <gerep> ikonia: that's why I asked what's the channel :) you know it?
[11:48] <Wiz_KeeD> now i'm stuck, only idea that comes to mind is to restart
[11:48] <Daisyab__> ikonia: it gives  me /root
[11:48] <gerep> ikonia: thanks ;)
[11:48] <ikonia> gerep: READ the ubottu gave you
[11:48] <ikonia> Daisyab__: what command did you do "su...." exactly.
[11:48] <gerep> #linuxmint-help
[11:48] <ikonia> gerep: read it PROPERLY
[11:48] <ikonia> gerep: it's not on freenode
[11:48] <Daisyab__> su -$denis
[11:48] <gerep> ikonia: sorry, I'm really stupid today hahaha
[11:48] <ikonia> it's not funny
[11:48] <Wiz_KeeD> any idea ObrienDave ?
[11:48] <gerep> ikonia: thanks a lot, that will help ;)
[11:48] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... it's not that difficult. just takes some getting used to is all
[11:48] <Daisyab__> denis is the name of otheruse
[11:48] <Daisyab__> *otheruser
[11:49] <universal> !kernel
[11:49] <ubottu> The core of Ubuntu is the Linux kernel: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel - You shouldn't have to compile your own, and if you need to troubleshoot issues, you can try a !Mainline kernel instead, but if you insist, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile (see also !Stages)
[11:49] <ikonia> Daisyab__: what's the exact command you typed please.
[11:49] <Wiz_KeeD> I think it's extremly difficult for these special cases, any retard can learn to apt-get install update and remove and kiill a few procceses in minutes
[11:49] <Wiz_KeeD> But for this complex tasks almost nobody has the answer
[11:49] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: please don't call people retards
[11:49] <Daisyab__> ikonia: it was su -$denis
[11:49] <ikonia> Daisyab__: ok, please do "exit" so you are back to your normal user, than do "su - denis"
[11:50] <Wiz_KeeD> i'm not calling anyone retard, I was speaking generally to make the idea of "easy" more vivid :)
[11:50] <ikonia> Wiz_KeeD: so don't do it please.
[11:50] <Wiz_KeeD> How can I close all instances of backintime thing now...and uninstall it
[11:50] <Daisyab__> ikonia: where denis takes the place of 'otheruser'
[11:50] <Wiz_KeeD> Or should I restart first...
[11:50] <universal> ikonia: what about updating kernel to a newer version which contains latest wl drivers
[11:50] <ikonia> Daisyab__: is denis the name of the broken user
[11:50] <ObrienDave> don't need to uninstall BackInTime
[11:51] <Wiz_KeeD> Laptop moves right now like it has 200mb of ram
[11:51] <ikonia> universal: use the kernel ubuntu provides
[11:51] <universal> ikonia: yea...how to do it ?
[11:51] <Wiz_KeeD> ObrienDave, need to stop it since it's killing my box and I see it in ps -aux | grep backintime
[11:51] <Wiz_KeeD> even though I've closed everything
[11:51] <Wiz_KeeD> And it's not running...
[11:51] <ikonia> universal: you already are using the kernel ubuntu provides
[11:51] <ikonia> universal: so stick with it
[11:52] <Wiz_KeeD> And what's the point in keeping it there if i'm not going to use it ObrienDave ? :)
[11:52] <Guest87684> ObrienDave, the menu that shows hard drives, and stuff well i guess the windows equivalent is "computer"
[11:52] <Wiz_KeeD> anyway, I will restart now
[11:52] <Wiz_KeeD> Since I don't know anything beter to do
[11:52] <ObrienDave> Wiz_KeeD... go ahead and power off the machine
[11:53] <universal> ikonia: no i mean the updated kernel....my system is 13.04 and now 13.10 is expected to be rolled out next month so there should a newer kernel
[11:53] <ikonia> universal: so you upgrade when 13.10 is available
[11:53] <Wiz_KeeD> I can't, it moves too slow
[11:53] <Daisyab__> ikonia: just did that and entered password then i get an error message -su export: '=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/home/denis/lampp': not a valid identifier.  denis is the name of the broken account
[11:53] <Wiz_KeeD> :))
[11:53] <Wiz_KeeD> Great os
[11:53] <universal> ikonia: no fixes for now ? :(
[11:54] <ikonia> Daisyab__: ok, sounds like th profile is messed up a bit
[11:54] <ObrienDave> Guest87684... Ubuntu does not use that type of a menu
[11:54] <ikonia> Daisyab__: can you type "id" please.
[11:54] <ikonia> Daisyab__: (as the user denis)
[11:54] <ikonia> Daisyab__: show me the output
[11:54] <nugroho> 11.5015.201081.0001 33.7415.201081.0001
[11:54] <ObrienDave> Guest87684... you need to start with the folder called "file system"
[11:55] <Guest87684> obriendave, in 12.04 i think there use to be that menu by moving ur mouse up to places then computer
[11:55] <Daisyab__> what do you mean as the user denis
=== hherholz is now known as HeikoH
[11:55] <Guest87684> obriendave, it shows all the listed drives and stuff
[11:55] <ObrienDave> Guest87684... then MOUNTED drives would be listed under the /mnt folder
[11:55] <ikonia> Daisyab__: su - denis, then id
[11:56] <ObrienDave> Guest87684... that's been removed in 13.04 i think
[11:56] <Guest87684> obriendave, yeah that was my question, can we get that back?
[11:56] <ObrienDave> Guest87684... not sure, I run Xubuntu
[11:57] <Guest87684> obriendave, alright thx for the help
[11:57] <ObrienDave> Guest87684... sorry i could not help you batter
[11:58] <ObrienDave> *better
[11:58] <Guest87684> obriendave, No problem thx for helping anyways
[11:59] <Daisyab__> ikonia: result: uid = 1000(denis) gid = 1000 (denis)  groups = 1000 (denis), 4 (adm), 20 (dialout), 24(cdrom), 46(plugdev), 111(lpadmin), 119(admin), 122(sambashare), 127 (guest)
[11:59] <ikonia> Daisyab__: ok, that's good.
[11:59] <ikonia> Daisyab__: can you do "pwd" too and show me the output
